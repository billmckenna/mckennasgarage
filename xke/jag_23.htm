<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The work on 
  this page has taken about 1 month and was during February and March 2004. I 
  would estimate about 40 hours of work.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gluing in the 
  vent supports with Sika-Flex was straight forward. I had scribed the exact place 
  of each while the bonnet was together and mounted on the car. I sanded out all 
  the primer and filler from my previous attempt at gluing them in to give a good 
  scuffed surface for adhesion. Sika-flex is interesting stuff, it dries slowly 
  and turns into a hard rubber. It gives a slight amount without cracking, and 
  is nearly impossible to get off once its dry. One calk tube was more than enough 
  to do the entire bonnet.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Before finial 
  gluing in the vent supports I did as much as possible to get a flush fit. This 
  involved some minor bending of the braces. The fit was nearly perfect in most 
  areas with less than 1/8&quot; gap in the worst places.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was one 
  area where the fit was hard to get perfect, I had no way to bend the part enough 
  to get a perfect fit. I ended up using Sika-flex to fill in the gap. It was 
  less than 1/4&quot;. I have noticed this area having a larger gap on many if 
  not all E-types.</font></strong></tt> </p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A nice tight fit 
on most the vents is best, here its pretty much dead flat on the bonnet. I opted 
to strip all the old paint off the mounting hardware before re-installing it. 
After three or four coats of paint and being taken on and off a few times, the 
hardware was looking pretty bad. Stripping was simple I just soaked all the fasteners 
in parts cleaner and the paint came right off.</font></strong></TT>

  <IMG SRC="bonnet7_1crop.jpg" HEIGHT=426 WIDTH=636> 
</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Its just about 
  ready to go back on the car now. I didn't glue the front panels in until after 
  painting so you can see the white Sika-flex on the right side. I'll touch this 
  up later when the last coat of primer is shot on the outside of the bonnet.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sill gussets, 
  came out pretty well, I will need to do a little minor dressing on the front 
  edge, and see how the fit is after I mount the bonnet again. </font></strong></TT></p>

  <IMG SRC="bonnet7_11crop.jpg" HEIGHT=379 WIDTH=619>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sill looks 
a bit wavy from this angle, but this is the shape that worked when the bonnet 
was dialed in. </font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After getting 
  the bonnet back together and painted, it was remounted to the car and the final 
  fitting was done. I had previously done some blocking around the cowl so things 
  were close, however not close enough. I loaded filler in several more times 
  and sanded out to get a perfect fit. 90% of the filler gets sanded away, but 
  its quickest to do lay down several coats and feather it back about 6-9 inches 
  from the cowl and rear edge of the bonnet. Ding down any major high spots and 
  fill over the small ones. I use 220 wet and dry sandpaper to rough these in, 
  then cut over to 400 grit. After I feel like I have it dialed in, I will shoot 
  another coat of high build on the bonnet.</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Its amazing what 
a long board will find when you put it to the primer. Here I'm trying to get 3 
high spots to go under. Two on the edge of the fender at the sill, and one on 
the side of the cowl. This kind of work takes patience and the natural tendency 
is to try and cover the high spot not the low areas around it. Save time and just 
lay in filler all around the offending high and you'll save time in the end.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For whatever reason 
the edge of the wing had some ugly High spots on both sides, I must have filled 
and sanded each about ten times before I was happy. I can't begin to state how 
frustrating this part of the process is.</font></strong></TT>

</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After all the 
  high spots seemed to be taken care of I shot another coat of primer. This was 
  a very heavy coat of PPG NCP 280. I made up a quart and slightly over reduced 
  it to get it to flow into any hidden low spots. Then I shot on the bonnet, cowl, 
  sills and door until I ran out. Probably about 2-3 coats on each. The bonnet 
  isn't latched in this picture, so you can see the edge of it sticking up.</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looks pretty good 
from here except where I had some spray gun problems, note the area on the cowl 
around the door. The gun had a loose tip and was spewing a bit when I first started. 
Would have been a major problem if this had been color, but for primer its no 
big deal.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another shot down 
the side of the car, several high and low spots will show up under the block but 
its 95% straight now.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ready for another 
pass with the 400 and 600 grit sanding, hopefully this will be the last pass.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another touch 
  up pass will be required on this to get out a few missed high spots and some 
  accidental sand through.</font></strong></TT> </p>

  <IMG SRC="bonnet9_3crop.jpg" HEIGHT=359 WIDTH=651>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One last shot 
for this page, I will end up doing several weeks of finial sanding on the car 
and 2 more touch up passes with high build before its all ready for color. The 
chrome fitting will be next. I ordered a full rubber kit from Classic Jaguar, 
and will test fit all the chrome before I shoot color. I'm having bumpers custom 
made for the car based on templates I have cut of the front and rear body contour.</font></strong></TT>
