<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Building a rotisseie 
took a 3 day weekend memorial day weekend 2002. About 20 hours over 3 days. This 
includes learning to weld, as well as mounting the car and fine tuning.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="weldtools1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The required tools 
are simple, an angle grinder with the various grinding wheels, a good heavy set 
of leather gloves, vice grips, wire brush, and a torch with eye protection. I 
had never used a gas welding rig before so there was some learning curve. First 
I read a book on welding. Then practiced on scrap metal before I started. I quickly 
learned that the natural tendency is to not heat the metal enough. This makes 
poor quality weak welds. Don't be afraid to heat the metal up cherry red before 
starting the braze. On thick steel pipe it isn't easy to melt through, the braze 
should flow on and be a bubbly liquid without beading. WHen the metal is beading 
its not hot enough.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rotsteel2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I designed the 
rotisserie based on a few I had seen on other sites, a tape measure, and a napkin. 
Its built from 3 inch square pipe bought from a local steel yard. The steel cost 
about $150 plus $50 in wheels. The steel yard made all the cuts for me. They charged 
$1 per cut. but lost track after the first 5-6 cuts so I ended up getting all 
the cuts done for about $10, worth every penny. For all the other cuts I used 
a skill saw with a metal blade, its slow but works. I'm sure I would have gone 
through at least 3 10 dollar metal blades everything.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="weldrig1.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the welding 
rig. I didn't own any welding equipment when I started this project and a friend 
loaned this to me. He hadn't used it in years and let me keep it as long as I 
needed. Worked perfectly for me once I learned how to braze. I made about 6 welds 
which I later had redo before I got the hang of it.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rotsteel3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First I built 
steel boxes which sleeved over the main uprights on which the car mounts. You 
can see them on the left, then the frames. If I had it to do over I wouldn't make 
the square plate on the end of the pipe as big. The rear one should be about the 
size of a license plate, and the front one didn't need to be more than 6-8 inches 
square. Mine were both 12 inches square. The larger plates get in the way when 
trying to do work on the front and rear of the car. Its not a huge problem, but 
could be better.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rot2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here I've got one 
of the frames built up. Its four feet wide, by four feet tall, and four feet long. 
Each end will have three casters. One with a lock on each end.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rotwheel3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I used standard 
1/2&quot; bolts to attach the casters. I drilled and tapped the thread right into 
the steel. Its simple enough, but a lot of hard work. Burned out at least 2 drill 
bits on this process.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rotwheel2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a shot 
of the holes getting tapped for a wheel. Notice the engine on the stand in the 
back ground. I put it in a garbage bag to stop oil from dripping all over the 
place.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rot3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the basic 
unit before wheels, many more holes to drill and tap. Tap bolts into the vertical 
shaft at several levels to hold the car up. I started with one 1/2&quot; bolt 
on the rear, but upgraded these to 9/16&quot; later. On the pipe, I welded a 3/4&quot; 
Nut and drilled through the outer sleeve. The friction of the bolt pressing on 
the inner pipe lets the car be turned to any position and hold the angle. I welded 
a big washer on the top of the bolt so I didn't need a wrench to adjust the pressure.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rotwheel4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now with wheels 
on and ready to mount. on the car. Still need to build the other end. I use the 
engine crane to adjust the level of the car, just attach the crane to the rotation 
pipe and crank it up or down. Once the correct level is achieved, drill and tap 
a new hole in the vertical to hold the position. I've sometimes use a come along 
strapped over the top of the post and anchored on the bottom bar to do this as 
well. The come along doesn't work as well, but is allot easier to get setup. Height 
changes are rare so its not a big issue.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="goodjoint1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is an example 
of what a joint should look like. Actually its not perfect, but at least solid. 
If you do brazing and see beads of brass or bubbles, The weld is to cool and will 
break, or peel off. Its not easy to melt steel at this thickness so don't worry 
about burn through.</font></strong></TT>

  <IMG SRC="rot5.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320>
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neglected to take 
many pictures to show building the front of the Rotisserie, but it was the same 
with exception of the body mounting bracket. I used one inch square stock. and 
make little L brackets which bolted on where to the top outer sub frame mounts. 
I should have used two inch square or thicker side wall one inch stock. The one 
inch stock bent under the weight of the car causing me to have to add an angle 
iron brace to stiffen it up. I had some poor quality brazes also which caused 
a scare, when transporting the car to the blaster.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rot4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here both ends 
of the car mounted to the Rotisserie, just need to put the center bar in. The 
center bar keeps everything lined up, won't let the inner sleeve back out of the 
outer one when moving the the car around.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="bodyonstand1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the 
  finished product. Works great! After everything was finished I had $250 in this 
  tool, and 3 full days of work. If I did another one I could probably do it in 
  2 days. Nothing makes working on the car better than easily being able to get 
  to any part of the car you need to. The whole thing is a little hard to move 
  around for one person on a hill, but is just fine on flat ground. My driveway 
  is slightly sloped and so I rarely take the car outside. Now that the body is 
  easy to move and all areas access able its time to go to the sand blasters!</font></strong></TT></p>
