<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The engine 
  machine work is one of the few things you really can't do in a garage, especially 
  on this motor. It was a mess, I replaced the crank, had the engine re-sleeved, 
  had major welding done on both the head and the block due to water jacket rust 
  and corrosion. The shop put in 20 hours of labor just on the head. The entire 
  bill for machine work and parts was something like $5600. $2500 parts and the 
  rest labor. </font></strong></tt></p>

  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The block 
    on this car was in reasonable shape but the engine had been bored two or three 
    times so I had to put in new sleeves. I got bought them from LA sleeve. I 
    had the shop install the sleeves and bore them out to standard. I got new 
    standard size AE pistons, and had a replacement crank from another 3.8 Liter 
    engine ground .010 under on the mains and rods. The crank was balanced as 
    were the rods and pistons statically before assembly. The shop put in the 
    freeze plugs, but I did the block paint and the rest of the bock prep myself. 
    I used glyptol where I could, and put new copper washers on all the oil galley 
    bolts. I installed the new head bolts and torqued them down using the 2 bolt 
    technique. </font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I installed 
  a new distributor drive gear, and oil pump next. Its important when working 
  with any of the bearing cap bolts to have a good quality torque wrench and torque 
  down the main bolts to the correct setting. I installed new Woodrift keys and 
  put the gears on the crank next. Things come together pretty quickly if you 
  have all the parts you need up front. I shot oil into the pump and galleys as 
  much as possible to help get the prime up on the pump. One mistake I made at 
  this point is not getting the distributor shaft aligned to be at the right angle 
  when the engine is at top dead center on number six piston. This mistake cost 
  me some time and a oil pan gasket.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    New oil pump was from a later 4.2 liter Jaguar engine and has a larger displacement 
    than many of the original pumps. It required a custom adapter to be added 
    to the oil pickup pipe shown here. I used new tab washers all around when 
    putting these parts in. the last thing I need is something coming apart in 
    the oil pan!</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm just about 
  ready to put on the oil pan now, I just need to clean up the mating surface 
  and put down some gasket dressing. The engine shop didn't use glyptol in the 
  crank case, even though I asked for it, but otherwise did a good job. They had 
  the oil pan on the motor when I picked it up so I didn't notice it until I got 
  home. Not the end of the world I guess, since it didn't have it from the factory.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    next step is getting the timing chains in. I started off by getting the lower 
    timing chain tensioners in and torqued down. Then put the upper chain assembly 
    together!</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a quick 
shot of the cam chain cover with the output shaft gasket. I stuck with the original 
style gasket. Many Jag owners go to a later Teflon type seal which requires a 
slight mod to the crank. I didn't want to mod the engine so I stuck with the original. 
Hope it doesn't leak to much!</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The timing 
  chain gear assembly was a bit of a challenge to figure out but nothing a little 
  reading in the shop manual couldn't solve. Its really quite a complex setup 
  for its day! Most car engines in this era wouldn't have something like this. 
  Notice the new chain tensioners on the right side. All of the timing chain parts 
  are relatively inexpensive. About $200 for everything.</font></strong></tt>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a nice 
shot of the lower cam chain and the hydraulic chain tensioner. The tensioner on 
the left side, is spring loaded and has to be installed while the spring plunger 
is locked, after you get the chain in you take the bolt out of the back of the 
block and release the spring with an allen wrench, then replace the bolt and lock 
it down with its lock tab. Also notice the oil slinger and oil sealing spacer 
on the crank. This spacer is a common wear part which is often replaced. mine 
was in good shape.</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm ready go 
  put the timing chain cover on now. I used Red lock tight and new lock washers 
  on everything that didn't have lock tabs. </font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the 
  head back from the shop. This puppy was a major mess. I didn't take any pictures 
  of the water jacket before and after, but it was corroded to a point where most 
  people would have tossed it. Of course it had the correct matching numbers so 
  I didn't want to do this, so the engine shop had to do some major work on it. 
  They cut a hole in the deck and welded up an area where the water jacket had 
  corroded into the intake. Welded all the water ports. Pulled .030 of warp out 
  of the head in 4 stages. Replaced the seats, valve guides, bucket guides, buckets, 
  springs and valves. Decked off .010. They did a cc check and found 102 CC per 
  cylinder, They did pressure test on the completed head and it all checked out. 
  APM put in 20 hours of labor on a head is about 15 more than they usually take, 
  This head had 5 hours of welding alone. I'm buffing out the front. </font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the head 
  was buffed out I cleaned it with grease and wax remover and shot the gold paint.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <img src="engine2_28crop.jpg" height="367" width="522"> 
</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I used one 
  of the Cometic head gaskets which was .051 thick based on calculations done 
  by the shop. The calculation is based on .025 total cut from the head and .020 
  skim off the block. The shop had to first weld the block up around the water 
  ports where it had rusted, The rust pits were about .050 deep. After welding 
  up the ports they Skimmed .010. A previous rebuild had removed .010 so the total 
  became -.020 plus the -.025 skim on the head for a whopping total of .045. The 
  Cometic gasket is made of a composite material with steel embedded. Unlike steel 
  gaskets it compresses some under load. The .051 gasket should compress down 
  to about .045 with 54 foot pounds of torque theoretically. In this picture you 
  can see the gasket just before the head went on. I used aircraft grade permatex 
  gasket dressing on all the engine gaskets.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The head went 
  on without issue, The next step was setting up the timing. The cams had been 
  positioned to be exactly in the correct position when the caps cam caps were 
  torqued. You can see the notch in the cam exactly in the center. of the front 
  bearing cap. The engine is exactly in the top dead center position and the cam 
  chain mounting disks must be popped out of the gear to line up the bolt holes. 
  To do this, pop the gear onto the cam and tap it back with a brass drift until 
  it is full on the cam, then pop the wire keeper off the front and pull the center 
  out of the gear. Rotate the center until it lines up with the bolt holes and 
  pop it back into the toothed gear. This is hard to understand unless you are 
  doing it but is a really important thing to get right, and difficult to figure 
  out unless you've done it. Once the center is back in the gear and bolted up 
  put the wire keeper back in and put safety wire on the bolts.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here you can 
  see the the timing chain gear bolts properly setup and the timing chain tensioner. 
  You'll need a special tool to tighten the timing chain. I was fortunate enough 
  to be able to borrow one! Thanks Dick! I have the flywheel and water pump on, 
  but just have the water pump pulley stuck on for fit testing. I also bolted 
  up the motor mounts and oil filter housing.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a 
    shot just before I put on the external oil pipe. I am putting new copper washers 
    everywhere and topping those off with some gasket sealer for good measure. 
    After the oil pipes I'll put the valve covers and torque them down. That is 
    about it for this page. I will continue the rest of the motor construction 
    on the next installment</font></strong></tt></p>
