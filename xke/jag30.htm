<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Powder coating 
  is similar to plating in that it is a process which requires a good bit of prep 
  work and setup and is serial with the bottle neck being the oven. Each batch 
  of powder coated parts takes about 30 minutes in the oven. I try to do powder 
  coating and plating at the same time so I can dove tail the wait periods and 
  maximize time.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Powder coating 
  is like painting in that finish quality is completely dependent on the prep 
  work. The cleaner the surface the better, I can't stress that enough, clean 
  clean clean is a must. The first step is bead or sandblasting the parts down 
  to bare metal. I use a bead blasting cab for this, typically I go over parts 
  two or three times to get all of the rust, paint, plate, scale off. After blasting 
  the parts, I hose them down with water to get any dust and beads of the part. 
  As soon as the part has been washed, I blow it dry with compressed air and spray 
  a phosphate metal wash on it to prevent flash rust. As soon as the metal wash 
  is dry I store the parts in clean cardboard boxes until I'm ready to powder 
  coat. If the parts sit more than about a week, I need to put them back in the 
  bead cab and start over.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second 
  step of the process is masking or plugging any areas where you don't want powder 
  to go. Powder coating unlike painting, produces a thicker build typically and 
  is much harder to get off once its cured. It is almost impossible to bead blast 
  off, and standard paint stripper cuts it very slowly. I cut it off with a knife 
  or dremel tool when I miss a spot with tape or plugs, When I strip an entire 
  part, I first heat the part for an hour at 600 in the oven and then bead blast 
  and strip with paint stripper. This often takes four or five cycles between 
  stripper and blasting. Its tough stuff! This is a picture of a plug kit I use 
  for filling small holes or capping threads on parts. After masking up all the 
  treads and plugging the holes I wire the parts to an oven rack making sure I 
  get good electrical contact between the part and the rack. The powder coating 
  gun works based on very high voltage electrical current. The part is connected 
  to negative (ground) and the powder gets a positive charge. As the powder comes 
  out of the gun it is instantly attracted to the part, without current most of 
  the powder falls off.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Powder 
    selection is a long subject, most under hood parts can be done in polyurethane, 
    polyester TGIC, or epoxy with good results, I used all with good results. 
    Here's a mix of Eastwood Hotcoat powders. There are hundreds of colors and 
    types available, but in my restoration its all gloss black, silver, clear, 
    and white etc. I tend to try and keep the common colors in the bottle I will 
    use to shoot them. then I just clean the gun and thread the new color bottle 
    on. I have a Harbor Freight powder gun which works fine, and was a good bit 
    cheaper than the Eastwood models. Unlike painting the powder coating gun isn't 
    critical for a good finish. It just spews the powder out and the electrical 
    charge does the rest.</font></strong></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once I have 
  all the parts masked up, hung on the rack and the powder gun loaded. I pre heat 
  the oven to about 400 degrees, and pre heat the parts for five to ten minutes. 
  Pre heating helps in several ways. It boils off any moisture which may be left 
  on the parts and the pre heated part accepts the powder from the gun better 
  than a cool part. Usually the powder starts to melt as soon as it hits the part 
  keeps more powder on the part especially in the low places which are typically 
  harder to cover. I use a standard oven thermometer to monitor the temp. In my 
  case the built in thermostat is slightly cooler than the oven thermometer, once 
  I got familiar with the delta in shown temp. verses actual I didn't really need 
  the thermometer any more. I tend to run the oven about 400 degrees for most 
  powders and have had good results. Slight over heating is better than under 
  heating in my experience, and over baking a part to cure it is better than under 
  curing. </font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
    pre-heating the parts I shoot the powder. This is done at very low pressure 
    5-10 psi and with a negative charge on the part. The powder is positively 
    charged and sticks to the heated metal. It is possible to load a thin or thick 
    coat of powder on the part just by continuing to spray the powder after the 
    part is coated. I tend to put a thin coat of powder on parts which are more 
    visible under the hood, and heavier on suspension parts where I know they 
    will take more abuse. When I really load the powder on the parts I get some 
    orange peel in the cured powder. In this picture I'm cooling a rack of parts 
    after baking for 25 minutes. Cooling takes about 30 minutes, but can take 
    longer for large or heavy parts.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a great 
  example of what not to do when powder coating! First my wire hangers were poorly 
  done and the part fell off as I was taking it out of the oven messing up the 
  finish. Second, notice the brown streak on the hub carrier, that is oil that 
  was inside the body. I didn't realize I had some small amount of grease inside 
  the part Once heated it turned into oil and streamed out of the part. It totally 
  ruined the clear powder coat on this part. Oil and powder coating do not mix. 
  Even the smallest amount of grease inside will cause problems. It is very easy 
  to have trapped dirt and oil in parts even after bead blasting. One good way 
  to fix this is to put the part through a longer pre-heating process at higher 
  temp. This will melt or burn off the oil. Then cool the part, go over again 
  with glass bead to get any micro oil off, Then wash with water, spray with Phosphate 
  &quot;metal wash&quot; coat and mask.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here 
    is the powder gun loaded up and ready to shoot clear polyester gloss! The 
    spraying technique isn't at all like paint. The powder comes out in a cloud 
    and which is generally moving towards the part. The material doesn't have 
    the forward pressure which wet paint does, so it is difficult to get into 
    hidden or recessed areas. I try to shoot at several angles to get build in 
    these places. Also the tip of the gun has a very high voltage low current 
    charge, so if you get it very close to the part electricity will arc off onto 
    the part. This doesn't seem to cause any problems but can scare you at first.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a pedal 
housing taped and plugged, just before being clear powder coated. All surfaces 
which will be mating with other metal or gaskets are left uncoated. The clear 
powder really just puts a protective coating on which will be easier to clean 
and nicer than bare metal.</font></strong></tt>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One person I found 
on the Internet had discovered that Eastwood ships powder in a nice sized plastic 
bottle designed to thread on their gun. The Harbor Freight gun has larger threads, 
so we both made adapters from the smaller bottles on the Harbor Freight gun. I 
don't mind copying a good idea when I see it! </font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Baking in action! 
  I am cooking some clear polyester in this picture and you can see it smoking. 
  Some powders give off more odor and smoke than others. I use clear, and black 
  allot, both tend to smoke a good bit when being cured, If I notice allot of 
  smoke coming out I open the door on the oven slightly to let the smoke escape 
  To much smoke could discolor the powder being baked on. especially clear coats.</font></strong></tt></p>
