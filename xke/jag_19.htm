<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was the first 
part to get color. I masked up the underside of the car, and bonnet wheel wells, 
but first shot a test on this inner panel from the bonnet. You can see how much 
orange peal I had on the first coat. Fortunately I found that the second clear 
coat helped cover this and as the clear dries it shrinks getting smoother. Before 
I did any painting I spent a day pressure washing my garage. I took everything 
out that was moveable and knocked all the dust off the floors and walls. every 
time I paint I wash the floor with water to knock down any dust which may be kicked 
up while walking. I try to paint only on days with almost no wind.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After I had the 
cleanest possible garage, I used two small fans to blow all dust away from my 
work area. The thought was that this would help keep dust from settling on the 
paint, and limit the toxic paint fumes in the work area. I don't have a fresh 
air breathing system, or a down draft paint booth so I just wore a full paint 
suit, high quality respirator and goggles.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I didn't take 
any pictures of the base coat only on the car, but it goes on flat, and is a very 
thin coat, mixed 50/50 with reducer. Its almost impossible to get runs in the 
base coat if the gun is set up correctly (medium spray pattern). The clear coat 
is a little harder, as it is thick and goes on heavy like a primer. Because it 
is so heavy it dries slower than the base coat and with the thick build runs are 
likely if you aren't careful. It runs but only if you really lay down a thick 
coat in a vertical area. I started with a thin tack coat and then did a second 
or third pass to get build. </font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The color really 
looks nice after the clear coat. Its strange stuff, the base coat is flat and 
doesn't look at all metallic. After the clear goes on it looks glossy but still 
no metallic flake. After the clear coat dries does it show off the metal flake. 
One really nice thing about painting in Northern CA, is that the temp and humidity 
is nearly perfect most of the time.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="paint1_2crop.jpg" HEIGHT=515 WIDTH=409> 
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I turned the car 
up on its side to paint the clear hoping that the dust wouldn't settle on the 
car. I put the fans off camera to the right to blow dust away, and left the car 
on its side until the paint was dry to touch. The 2055 clear dries to touch in 
about 1 hour, the DCU base coat only takes about 30 minutes get to the same point.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The transmission 
  tunnel gets the same treatment. Areas like this are hard to paint effectively 
  with a large gravity fed gun. The large paint tank makes it hard to get into 
  tight areas. On the inside of the car I used a touch up gun first to get all 
  the tight areas with color before switching over to the larger gun. I would 
  recommend buying a cheap knock off HVLP touch up gun. I have a Sears high pressure 
  touch up gun which is alright but after using HVLP its not easy to go back. 
  I do find that lowering the pressure to the minimum on a regular gun helps. 
  Over pressuring a gun seems to be one of the most common reasons for orange 
  peel. </font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a week more 
of sanding and prep work on the inside of the body I masked up and shot the same 
color and clear on the inside. As mentioned before the the tight areas of the 
body were done with a touch up gun. Since I did wet sanding on the inside of the 
body I had to spend a good bit of time between each coat getting paint dust out 
of the corners of the body. For this I found a small tooth brush and high pressure 
air gun to be the best bet. After this I did 2 passes with grease and wax remover. 
Clean is good where paint is concerned. I had no issues with fish eyes and only 
minor dust in the clear coat.</font></strong></TT>

</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trunk area 
around the spare tire will be just about the only part of the interior which will 
be visible once the car is complete. I took extra time to sand out and prep the 
spare tire area. I may even go as far as color sanding this if I get really crazy.

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much better 
  than new, seems a shame to cover it up, but all this will be eventually covered 
  in red leather interior, should be sharp. I'll need to clean the threads inside 
  the body with taps as soon as the paint is good an dry.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that everything 
  is painted I will be taking the car off the rotisserie and mounting the bonnet. 
  I will mask up the inside of the car to keep any sanding dust or primer etc 
  from getting inside the car while I do the finial sanding. No reason to have 
  to clean all this again.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One more picture

  picture. Won't show up when covered but would have been easy to fix.</font></strong></TT>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I Painted the 
  frame rails at the same time. These were not easy to get completely covered 
  I put two coats of color on and rotated each part to insure good coverage on 
  all sides, but still a few areas came up a little thin on paint. I may have 
  to do some touch up later.</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two small dents 
  in one of the original frame rail. I didn't see these as big enough to force 
  replacement. both are going to be almost impossible to see when the engine is 
  in place.</font></strong></tt>
