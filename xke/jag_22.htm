<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The work on  this page has taken about 2 months in Decemeber 2003 and January 2004. Granted these are winter months where work progresses at about half of the summer pace.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First off I 
  took the bonnet completely apart and cut the lower valance out of the tub. The 
  valance contains the mount points for the hinges and was bowed from accident 
  damage. I found that the sheet metal in the lip of the tub was weak and thin, 
  so I cut out about two inches and welded in new metal. The last thing you need 
  in the tub is weak metal. This part of the bonnet takes allot of abuse and carries 
  the weight of the bonnet over many bumpy roads. We wouldn't want it changing 
  shape on us once its in production. Here I'm planishing out the new lip with 
  hammer and dolly. Notice the safety glasses, this is possibly the first time 
  I've used these things in years.</font></strong></TT></p>

</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After fixing 
  up the tub, I repaired the valance. Here I'm filling holes drilled to get the 
  original spot welds out. Notice the copper backing plate. These copper plates 
  are a wonderful help when doing plug welding, saves countless hours of grinding. 
  I welded several steel plates into the back side of this valance to help reinforce 
  the hinge points. This was a weak area of the bonnet design and prone to failure. 
  Minor mods like this will be completely hidden once the car is back together 
  but will hopefully keep the bonnet nice and tight over the years.</font></strong></TT></p>

</CENTER>
<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes after 
grinding down the welds I find small holes where the metal didn't fill the original 
hole completely. I go over these again but without a backing plate. Just a touch 
here and there fills the holes and makes a perfectly clean surface ready to weld 
back into the tub. After cleaning up the parts I welded the valance back into 
the tub 1/4&quot; further forward, than it had originally been. This was an attempt 
to get account for the large gap at the rear edge.</font></strong></tt>

  <IMG SRC="bonnet4_7crop.jpg" HEIGHT=485 WIDTH=602> 
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After much welding, 
and fighting to get the bonnet back together and on the car, I found that things 
were much closer. Still not right but heading in the right direction. Before taking 
this picture I still had some of the original center section shape mismatch where 
the outside was higher than the center, but my dad came up with a quick way to 
reshape the center section. Use a 2x4 brace it on the sub frame or fire wall lip 
on one end, then put the other end on the rear bonnet support. Have one person 
hold the bonnet in place and another person lay their body on the bonnet pushing 
down on the 2x4. The stiffener will give slightly and allow you to slowly match 
the shape of the bonnet to the cowl. Make sure you don't go to quickly with this 
as its a real pain to bend it back the other way.</font></strong></TT>

</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here you can 
  see things are coming along, still need to do a bit of warping on the center 
  section stiffener to get the outer edge flush with the cowl. After things get 
  within 1/8&quot; I use the sheet metal vice grips in the foreground to flex 
  the edge into line with the cowl.</font></strong></TT></p>

  <IMG SRC="bonnet5_13crop.jpg" HEIGHT=701 WIDTH=287> 
</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a bit 
  more banging and tweaking, I had to make a decision about the rear edge. Here 
  I have taken all the shims out and the wings the side have a near perfect gap, 
  but the center section is to close to the cowl. I could put shims back in and 
  weld metal to the wings, or cut the center section down to the right fit. I 
  opted to cut the center section as the rear edge wasn't straight anyway and 
  adding metal to the wings would have possibly warped the wings. </font></strong></TT></p>

</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After another 
afternoon of banging, cutting and filing, the bonnet is looking much better, I 
have a 1/8&quot; gap all the way around. I still have a little filing to do on 
the center blister to get a straight edge on it but the rest of the gap is pretty 
well locked in and its time to get the lower wings blended in to the body with 
lead. </font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is starting 
to look like a car again now, I still have many hours of sanding and filling to 
go but at least the bonnet is on and flush with a 1/8&quot; gap all the way around.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first step 
before leading in the sill to make it blend perfectly with the wing, is cleaning 
off and tinning the metal. I had wasted effort filling and priming this area.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I didn't take 
any pictures in progress of leading the sills, but it wasn't anything difficult 
after the lead work on the door jams and rear deck.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting the fender 
contour to match was quick work, Just lay in more lead in than required and file 
it down to fit.</font></strong></TT>

  <IMG SRC="bonnet5_6crop.jpg" HEIGHT=367 WIDTH=622> 
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here I have everything 
filed and sanded down and ready for a quick skim of plastic filler. </font></strong></TT>

  <IMG SRC="bonnet5_21crop.jpg" HEIGHT=350 WIDTH=631> 
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things are just 
about there now, need to skim some plastic and then long board. After I get the 
highs and lows roughed out, I'll take the bonnet off, disassemble it again, then 
sand out the inside. Glue in the vents with sika-flex and shoot two coats of high 
build primer, and put it back together. Then refit it to the car and pray things 
are close. After that its more block sanding, trial fitting the chrome, and prep 
to paint color.</font></strong></TT>
