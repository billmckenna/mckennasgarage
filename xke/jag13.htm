<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trunk tub 
  was shot. I could have spent 50 hours trying to weld up all these holes, pull 
  out the dents and patch in half of the boot floor. The sheet metal is paper 
  thin in most of the floor and would never be right. So decided early on that 
  since Martin Robey makes replacement tubs I'd bite the bullet and replace it 
  all. I ordered a, new tub, upper deck, tail light filler, license plate frame 
  etc. All these parts cost about $1500 with freight from England. The shipping 
  was $440 of the total. Everything got stuck in customs for two weeks, and the 
  order took about two weeks to fill because MR doesn't keep S1 XKE trunk tubs 
  in stock. So the net is, for those repeating this process, plan ahead on the 
  sheet metal order. </font></strong></TT></p>

<p><font size="+1"><TT><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The first 
  task was to build a stand to support the body while the trunk replacement was 
  in process. The car needs be movable as well. I used two inch square pipe, cut 
  it with a skill saw with a metal blade and welded it together to create this 
  master piece in about an hour. It isn't adjustable but does move the shell safely 
  around the garage for easy access.</strong></font></TT></font> </p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The shell just 
sits on on the stand with a couple of plywood shims to keep the body level and 
prevent marring of the primer. These also shims also distribute the weight so 
that there won't be any dents in the deck. </font></strong></TT>

</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next step 
  was much spot weld drilling. Plan on going through about 5 cobalt drill bits 
  to get all the welds out. I did a good bit of this before building the stand 
  in the previous pictures, because its much easier to drill out the welds when 
  the car is up on its side. After the tub comes off I'll fill the holes in the 
  shell with the mig welder and then tap new holes into the new tub after its 
  perfectly aligned and locked into place. When starting this project I had intended 
  to buy a spot welder, but after experimenting with drilling and simulating spot 
  welds with the mig I found that it can be made to look close enough to OEM for 
  my eye. Certainly not perfect, but after the car is prepped and painted it will 
  be pretty hard to tell that these weren't original.</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No turning back 
from here. I started off trying to cut only the welds and pull the tub off, but 
figured out pretty quickly that it was allot easier to just torch out the tub. 
It is hard to get some of the spot welds out with the tub on the car and since 
the metal is all going to the trash anyway, I just fired up the torch and cut 
out the rear end out in less than an hour.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It ain 't pretty, 
  you can see some of the rust just about to eat through this panel. Glad I didn't 
  patch this up. Wonder how much more rust deep in the inner body panels I'm missing. 
  This part of the tub traps dirt and dust, the corner was full of crud which 
  had absorbed water and was slowly rotting away the inner supports. I had a small 
  fire inside the panel while torching out these corners. Forty years of leaves 
  and sticks and old bondo mixed with dirt burns really well.</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting the tub 
off was quick work, the license plate frame went a bit slower but since everything 
is being replaced including the deck up to the hatch, there was no reason to waste 
allot of time trying to be graceful. </font></strong></TT>

  <IMG SRC="trunkcut_018.jpg" HEIGHT=291 WIDTH=389>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All out. This 
is just the beginning I'll spend several afternoons prepping the drill holes and 
cleaning up the area before I am ready to start fitting the new tub.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is an example 
of how poorly these cars were prepped for rust. They didn't even paint the inside 
of these panels. No wonder every restoration of an XKE I've seen is a lesson in 
rust repair. The accident damage and shotty repair work added to the problems. 
And still this car is better than average since it was a FHC and a California 
car. </font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A close up of 
the rear end disaster, you can see one of my repairs on the top left corner. This 
wasn't my best work and will get cleaned up now that the trunk is out. This is 
a great area for copper backing plates for welding up holes in sheet metal. Thick 
copper plates are used to stop weld material from bubbling out the back of a hole 
when you welding, Copper welding plates are for sale at better welding shops and 
Eastwood. I have used mine hundreds of times so far.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cleaned up all 
the holes, sanded out the rust and shot thinned POR 15. Need to put another coat 
on before the tub goes on. Still need to cut out the tail light lips, and mounting 
brackets, all will be replaced.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="boot7.jpg" HEIGHT=312 WIDTH=416>
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oops didn't think 
about masking until it was too late. Fortunately a little thinner will take off 
POR 15 and the DP40 under it for that matter. This area will be coated by several 
more coats of high build primer and will get light sanding before the color coat, 
but that's many moons away.</font></strong></TT>

  <IMG SRC="boot2.jpg" HEIGHT=384 WIDTH=288> 
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gas tank filler 
wasn't rusty, but everything gets paint. I will wax inside of the fender wells 
after one more coat of POR 15.</font></strong></TT>

  <IMG SRC="boot4.jpg" HEIGHT=291 WIDTH=389>
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The spot weld 
holes are all cleaned up now and things are getting closer to fitting the new 
tub. I typically use a 4 inch angle grinder with a 36 grit flap disk to knock 
down the bulk of the welds and then smooth them out with a 90 degree air driven 
die grinder and a sanding disk. makes quick clean work of weld finishing without 
thinning out the surface to much.</font></strong></TT>
