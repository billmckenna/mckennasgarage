<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Its been a 
  while since I've put a new page up for various reasons ( work mostly), I have 
  been stuck in Diff rebuild hell from Oct. until May 2005. I never would have 
  come close to solving this if not for the expertise and determination of Dick 
  Vandermeyden. If you don't have a mill, lathe and all the associated experience 
  making parts don't consider changing out your rear end gears.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After cleaning 
  and prepping all the parts I hauled it all down to Dick's shop and we got started. 
  We found all sorts of issues in the first week. Worn parts which were not usable, 
  parts that didn't fit and were not exactly the same as the originals. Missing 
  and incorrect bearings. We divided the project into 4 areas, output shafts, 
  ring gear and clutch pack, Pinion, and finial setup. Both Dick and I read the 
  Diff section in the shop manual as well as the paper work which came with the 
  new ring and pinion several times before starting, hours of discussion followed 
  about how to recreate the setup tools shown in the Shop manual. The Reider Racing 
  Ring and pinion kit was good quality but not exactly the same as the original 
  parts. The documentation was ok, but it assumed you were putting the gears in 
  a later non Independent Axle housing so no mention of the output shafts was 
  made.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First problem, 
  some &quot;qualified&quot; jaguar mechanic along the way put the output shafts 
  together incorrectly, stacking the shims that should have gone between the two 
  roller bearings to prevent end play, between the outer bearing and the output 
  flange. The result was that the output bearings had end play and slapped back 
  and forth on the shims and output flange. This ruined the shims and output flange 
  and left me with two flanges which were worn down on the inside face as much 
  as .060, Dick found a new pair of good output flanges and we used these to setup 
  the output shafts. What is pictured is the ruined output flange. I this picture 
  doesn't show the side that is worn. It was the best picture I had. </font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    source four of the correct Timkin output shaft bearings from International 
    bearings $50 each! (not included in the kit from Reider Racing), then opted 
    to make a custom spacers to set the end play between the bearings. Normally 
    this would be done with shims and a standard sized spacer, but the shims were 
    trashed. Dick had some Stainless pipe the right size to make a spacer which 
    was exactly right. An added advantage of the custom spacer is that since there 
    is no shim pack there is nothing to loose in the next rebuild and no way to 
    put it together wrong. Thick shim packs also have a tendency to compress over 
    time which can allow more end play than recommended.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the output 
  shafts were complete we put the Ring gear on the clutch assembly. The original 
  Ring gear had larger bolts and so the housing had larger holes to take these 
  bolts. We had to make ten spacers to adapt the new ring gear to the older housing. 
  We made these out of stainless steel with the correct OD and ID to take up the 
  delta between the new and old bolt sizes. After this was complete we did some 
  test fitting shown here, to see how far the pinion was out when mating the ring. 
  We determined at this point that we were way off, the pinion was much to short 
  mating the ring gear even with all the shims we had behind the inner bearing 
  cup. At this point we had to stop and regroup. We needed tools we didn't have 
  to determine how to setup the pinion and we needed to reference the tools and 
  the setup with another Diff which was thought to be original and setup correctly.</font></strong></tt></p>
<center>
  <p><img src="torquetool1_crop.jpg" height="492" width="395"></p>
  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First 
    Dick made this Torque tool so that we could check the drag on the bearings 
    as we turned the pinion. The shop manual says that when the torque on the 
    pinion flange nut is set, the pinion should show 8-12 inch pounds of drag 
    on an appropriate tool Churchill number blah blah, Which of course everyone 
    has laying around their shop. Dick had the torque screw driver and made cross 
    bar out of stainless. </font></strong></tt></p>

  <img src="diff1_4crop.jpg" height="431" width="449"> 
</center>
<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next problem to 
solve, we had to devise a replacement tool for the pinion depth gauge shown in 
the shop manual. Several days of design and a couple of piles of metal shavings 
later, and Dick had this little beauty. On the left side is a setup tool that 
sits in the bearing cup and simulates the pinion level down to the thousandth, 
this is used mainly to validate the setup. The unit on the right sits on a magnet 
with a small pin which aligns it on the pinion, the small block is used to get 
the exact level relative to a set point on the case in the lowest point of the 
output flange opening. When everything is calibrated correctly and the pinion 
has the correct number of shims the dial should read zero plus the extra amount 
etched on the end of the pinion gear from the factory. In our case we determined 
that the pinion required .060 of shims, much more than what was sent with the 
kit. This made us question the entire setup. Dick happened to have another Diff. 
sitting around which was stock, so we tore it down and checked it with the new 
setup tools. It was spot on, so we knew we had a solid tool set and reference 
point and that it was the new pinion which was not the same. </font></strong></tt>

  <p><img src="Diffparts1_12crop.jpg" height="462" width="391"></p>
  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Further 
    examination of the new and old pinion brought us to the conclusion that over 
    the years slight changes were made in the dimension to take an oil slinger 
    and baffle which were not in the earlier cars. On later applications this 
    oil baffle and slinger were added and each was ~.030 thick. The missing .060 
    was now accounted for. Dick made a custom spacer to make up this extra space 
    and we were back in business. Well almost, we also found that the original 
    spacer and shims that went between the inner and outer bearing cones to prevent 
    excess loading on the bearings was missing, so we made a custom spacer for 
    this and cut it down until we got the correct pre load on the bearings to 
    create 8-12 inch pounds of drag when the pinion nut was fully torqued down 
    to 150 foot pounds. I think at this point we have about 20 custom parts in 
    the Diff.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After getting 
the pinion and output shafts dialed in, it was time to put it all together and 
get the tooth pattern and gear back lash set. We used this dial caliper on a tooth 
to show us the right lash in the gears. To set this you put shims behind the output 
housings and adjust them to move the Ring gear in or out of the pinion. This process 
takes a good bit of trial and error. When its set up properly there should be 
.008 - .012 of play between the pinion and ring. We ended up needing to make one 
shim out of .010 shim stock. for the right side output housing. This in turn required 
us to make a punch tool.</font></strong></tt>

</center>
<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a neat 
little punch tool Dick made to punch the right sized holes in .010 shim material. 
Its made of Stainless steel and we used a steel setup pin to make the punch. Just 
lock the block in the vice and use put the punch into the mill head. Put the shim 
stock over the hole and bring the head down like a drill press. It makes perfect 
holes every time.</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the Diff 
  was buttoned up we made quick progress on the rest of the IRS. I had already 
  put the brakes together and most of the other work was done. previously. I did 
  Powder coating on all the painted parts. Nickel plate on the steel parts. New 
  brake lines, the hub bearings were done already. Here Dick is sorting out shims 
  for the calipers. We had a heck of a time getting the calipers to go back into 
  the cage until we determined that I had the wrong Rotors. 3.8L cars have a different 
  Rotor than 4.2 cars.</font></strong></tt></p>
  <center>
  <img src="diff1_18crop.jpg" height="368" width="526"> 
</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you look 
  closely You can see the difference. The Rotor on the Left is for 3.8L the one 
  on the right is for 4.2L, Notice the holes in the center, these are required 
  to bolt up the caliper. 3.8 Rotors are about .030 thinner and have a greater 
  recess which allows the caliper to fit into the cage! We were scratching our 
  heads for quite some time before we figured this out. </font></strong></tt></p>

</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting all 
  the right parts collected and in order for the lower control arms was fun. I 
  have no idea what Jaguar was thinking on this design. It seems like they have 
  five times more parts than are really needed! Notice the new parts at the back 
  and the original parts up front. I was missing several small parts, and had 
  to few of this and that. The usual!</font></strong></tt></p>

  <img src="diff1_13crop.jpg" height="408" width="544"> 
</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once the correct 
  rotors were installed the brakes came together pretty quickly. The safety wires 
  were a small challenge but nothing after the Diff setup. Notice the spacers 
  on the rotor bolt shafts. These allowed us to torque down the rotor and get 
  the caliper properly shimmed without the half shafts in place.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <img src="carpics1_3crop.jpg" height="299" width="581"> 
</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next step 
  was to setup the hub carrier bearings and shim up these to have the right amount 
  of end play. Normally this is done with two spacers and shims, But we opted 
  to make a custom spacer and cut it down to the exact right length. You can see 
  two of the original spacers in the background. and in the front the new spacer, 
  this goes between the bearings and is cut down to have no more than .002 of 
  end play with the right torque of about 50 foot pounds on the shaft nuts. </font></strong></tt></p>

  <img src="carpics1_5crop.jpg" height="412" width="534"> 
</center>
  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is allot 
    of this kind of work when setting up the IRS. Here we are trying to determine 
    how much we need to cut off the custom made spacer by putting in temporary 
    shims and checking the end play with dial caliper (not shown). We cut one 
    of the original spacers in half and used it to simulate the forks of the fulcrum 
    arms. After we get the right end play with the shims off of the custom spacer. 
    Its good old fashioned trial and error.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <img src="carpics1_7crop.jpg" height="378" width="649"> 
</center>
  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once the hubs 
    and control arm forks were setup, progress was quick and smooth. It took about 
    an afternoon to get it all together and have the unit ready to go home and 
    install on the car. I'm guessing that the entire IRS weighs 250 pounds, Not 
    really practical to move with 2 men, I used an engine hoist to get it into 
    and out of my car.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After I had 
    the IRS back at home I put on the sway bar and mounting brackets. I spent 
    a few hours fiddling with the emergency brake. The auto tightening feature 
    is very primitive. I'm not sure what Jaguar was thinking with this setup but 
    it is possibly one of the worst designs I've ever encountered. If it isn't 
    perfectly installed and aligned it doesn't work. I used a furniture dolly 
    to move the IRS in place, and to align it to the car on the dolly. I'll then 
    lower the car onto the IRS.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First I had 
    to get the wheels on the front so I could lower the car onto the ground, This 
    was simple enough but seemed like a major milestone.</font></strong></tt></p>

    <img src="carpics1_54crop.jpg" height="303" width="578"> 
  </center>
  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next I rolled 
    the IRS under and lowered the car down onto the IRS very very slowly. It snapped 
    right in place. I used some small drifts and screw drivers to align the bolt 
    holes and shimmed around the mounting blocks where there was extra space.</font></strong></tt></p>

    <img src="carpics1_56crop.jpg" height="349" width="599"> 
  </center>
  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the 
    car on the Jack like this I could lower the body onto the IRS while it was 
    sitting on the dolly very simply. The dolly can support the IRS and the shell 
    if needed and has the natural tendency to align as the shell is lowered onto 
    it. I have no idea why people try lifting the IRS up onto the car. </font></strong></tt></p>

  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here she 
    is all bolted up and ready. The rest of the connections were simple enough. 
    Sway bar, control arms, drive shaft brake line, and emergency brake cable. 
    Went in without a hitch. The only difficult thing to get on is the nuts on 
    the back of the rear Suspension mounts. These are nearly hidden when the IRS 
    is installed, I used a long box end wrench and tape to hold the nut in place 
    while I threaded it on from the outside.</font></strong></tt></p>
