  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Maybe I'm 
    insane, but when I started looking at all the hardware I would have to replace 
    or have re plated and the complexity and expense of packing up all the little 
    parts out and hoping nothing was lost etc, it became clear that home plating 
    would be a better solution if I could do it with the same level of quality 
    as the professional shops. I already have a bead cab and buffing wheel, so 
    only the electro plating system was required. This is a 3 gal Copy Cad kit 
    I bought from <a HREF="http://www.caswellplating.com">Caswell plating.</a> It with a few additions allows for Silver Zinc, 
    Golden Zinc and Black oxide Zinc plating. In addition to the bucket in the 
    center, you'll need several other clean plastic buckets and a way to heat 
    water, some copper pipe for tank bars and brass or copper wire for hanging 
    parts. Plating is mildly dangerous as acid and other chemicals are required. 
    I wear heavy rubber gloves when working with the chemicals, and have an open 
    garage with good ventilation to avoid breathing concentrated fumes from the 
    plating tank. Zinc plating is not nearly as dangerous as Chrome or other heavy 
    metals, but still should be taken seriously. Ok enough of that safety talk.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I bought a cheap 
crock pot my local hardware store ($23) to heat water. Its important to have hot 
water for the parts cleaning system. The Plating tank is heated to around 90 degrees 
F. with a fish tank heater. The crock pot heats water to about 190 Degrees F. 
which is used for a soap solution for parts degreasing solutions. I use a second 
fish tank heater to heat a muratic acid solution as well. You can also see some 
of the other tools. hanger wire in Copper and Brass. A 1 Amp Power supply from 
local electronics store, Digital Thermometer. </font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Setup takes 
  several hours and I would recommend that if you do plating to save up at least 
  30-40 parts and do in a batch. this will take at least a day. Before starting 
  I bead blast all the parts twice to get all old plating or rust and visible 
  dirt off. This can be time consuming with small bolts; the threads are quite 
  difficult to get completely clean. The White bucket is clean water, The Blue 
  bucket is the Muratic acid solution, I mixed this about 20 to 1 with water. 
  20 parts water to 1 part acid very mild. I later freshened up the solution with 
  another part of acid when I notice the action slowing on new parts dipped. The 
  <a HREF="http://www.caswellplating.com">Caswell</a> manuals are very good and go through 
  all the details.</font></strong></tt> </p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After all the 
  parts were as clean as possible, I wired them up to the copper or brass wire 
  tank hanger wires. I tried to put smaller parts together on one string. The 
  more surface area the parts have the more power is required to plate. The manuals 
  go into this, and talk about using batteries and light bulbs to control current, 
  but really you need a fairly large DC power source between 1 and 12 volts at 
  up to 20 amps. Depends on what you are doing. a car battery and charger works 
  but a large Rheostat is needed, or other power soak are needed to control the 
  power. The best method for judging if you have the power right is to watch the 
  bubbles on the parts as they plate. To many bubbles and the plating will be 
  rough. Not enough and the plating comes out thin and dull gray. If you get parts 
  with a poor finish you can clean them up and plate again until the finish improves. 
  It takes practice but as with most things the more you do the better you get.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here you can 
  see the tank Anode, Copper tank bar, and my power supply. I cut part of the 
  anode to make a hanger and wired the to plates together to make them easy to 
  connect to the power. The small DC supply I bought wasn't nearly enough power 
  to do larger parts and over heated smoking finally as I turned it to higher 
  settings to try and get larger parts to plate. I will replace this on the next 
  batch with a battery or some other DC supply. I checked at Fry's (my local electronics 
  store) and found a 20 amp DC supply designed for bench test. It has controls 
  for amps and volts and digital meters etc. about $200.</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the 
  cleaning tank, <a HREF="http://www.caswellplating.com">Caswell</a> calls the powder 
  I mixed with water SP de greaser, but it feels and smells like laundry detergent 
  mixed with ammonia. I mix it with hot water and soak the clean parts in this 
  before dropping them into the acid tank. After plating is complete I soak the 
  parts in this to kill the acid from the plating tank. The parts I started with 
  were door locks and rear hatch hardware. I needed these parts to be clean and 
  rust free before I hung the door and hatch lid for finial fitting and block 
  sanding. These parts are mostly hidden when the car is complete so any sub standard 
  plating won't be visible in the finished car.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the acid 
tank at work parts bubbling away. I leave parts in this for around 30 minutes 
and then dumped them into a fresh water holding tank. The Fresh water tank kills 
the acid and slows down flash rust. Steel parts will flash rust in seconds after 
being pulled out of this acid bath. You can actually watch the rust form on parts. 
Even under water the parts start rusting while waiting to go into the plate tank. 
If parts stay to long in either water or acid tank you need to blast them and 
start over. </font></strong></tt>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the plating 
tank at work. The part I'm plating is the tank bar. This was the first part I 
plated. The manual says to start with your plating bar to purify the plating tank. 
This gets any foreign metal onto a part that doesn't matter and keeps your plating 
bar from corroding later. Copper turns green very quickly after coming in contact 
with acid and doesn't conduct. Notice the air pipe in the tank. This is a fish 

tank air pump and hose with a gang valve to control. It is used to agitate the 
plating solution while plating keeping bubbles from forming on the part. Bubbles 
which stick on the part can lead to a poor finish if they are aren't knocked off 
periodically. In the future I think I'll find a better solution for this. Possibly 
attach a vibrator t the tank bar. The air hose is hard to keep under water and 
near the part. The other solution to this problem is just to move the part by 
hand as the plating is in process. </font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are the 
  first parts done with the system. Not bad but could get better. The two pipes 
  at the front left are sections of copper pipe I used for tests. The rear parts 
  were plated in two batches the Spring as a batch and the brackets as a second 
  batch. As soon as the parts came out of the plating tank they went back into 
  the degreasing tank to kill the acid and then I cut the wires. Avoid touching 
  the parts until the dry and cool off. The acid and oil on your skin will leave 
  black smudges.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Larger parts like 
these door latches were plated whole. I was worried that the mechanics wouldn't 
work after plating if I didn't completely tear them down. This was not the case. 
These latches worked just fine after plating. The power supply I had wasn't powerful 
enough to plate such large parts so even though I left the parts in the tank for 
30 minutes or more they came out with a grayish tint in some areas. I helped correct 
this by flash dipping half of the part at a time for a few seconds. But still 
had some gray in the middle around the springs etc. </font></strong></tt>

  <img SRC="plate13.jpg" HEIGHT=340 WIDTH=447>
</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To quickly 
  plate small nuts and bolts I made this plating basket out of copper wire threaded 
  through holes in the bottom of this $.99 plastic basket from the hardware store. 
  The parts are just tossed into the basket and current flows through the copper 
  hangers. The parts make contact with the wire on the bottom. Occasional shaking 
  of the basket helps avoid any marks on the parts from the wires. My power supply 
  was a little weak but after some parts were removed it worked perfectly. With 
  a larger supply I could do several dozen parts at a time with this. setup. Saves 
  allot of time. This idea came from the very complete <a HREF="http://www.caswellplating.com">Caswell</a> plating manual. 
  So far I have been really impressed with how easy plating is once you get setup. 
  Its not something I'd recommend unless you have large quantities of parts. The 
  setup time is several hours and the total investment could be $200-$500 depending 
  on how serious you get. The kit and accessories was about $250. The parts from 
  the hardware store were $50. If I go with a high end Power supply its another 
  $200. Still I'd guess it pays for its self after 2-3 batches of parts. If I 
  avoid loosing 1 hard to find part it will be worth what I paid. Later in the 
  restoration I may get a Nickel plating kit for all the suspension parts. Will 
  need at least a 5 gallon tank for this. </font></strong></tt> </p>
