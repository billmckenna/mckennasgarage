  down, the wine and cheese of car restoration, until you find out what is wrong 
  and then its another story. It took me about a week to get everything stripped, 
  cleaned, sorted out and stored ready to choose an engine shop.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stripping down 
  any engine is messy work, make sure you are not wearing your best clothes and 
  have at least twenty disposable rags ready along with a gallon of something 
  to cut grease, a parts cleaning tank is a must too. Most of the tear down went 
  pretty quickly, but there are just allot of parts to remove and inspect so it 
  takes time. Here the cams are off and I'm ready to start unbolting the head.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many 
  unique things about the XK motor that you need to know up front, The shop manual 
  or one of the many other XK engine books should be fully read before you even 
  start. This picture is of the Cam chain adjuster which needs to be loosened 
  before you can get the head off. Notice I still have the bolts in the cam drive 
  gears at the top. </font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pop goes the 
  head. I was lucky this head wasn't stuck on. The head was not original, and 
  had been changed recently by the previous owner. From what the PO said it only 
  had a couple thousand miles on it before I started the restoration! Things looked 
  ok at first glance. No major problems.</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the head 
  came off I got into the bottom end. What a mess. You can see that even after 
  the oil had been drained there was still at least another quart left in the 
  journals. </font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things 
    looked ok in the crankcase. No metal or bearings which were chewed up. Sludge 
    levels were pretty low. and all the main bearing cap bolts had metal tabs 
    to prevent bolts from slipping.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can see 
  some of the signs of ring problems by looking at the head. The number one bore 
  at the bottom of the screen was reading below standard compression (about 150 
  psi). Its easy to see the oil which had been blowing by on the dome. When I 
  pulled the pistons I found cracked rings. </font></strong></tt></p>

    oil pump was fine but will be replaced with a later 4.2L pump from an XJ6. 
    The higher output pump is a standard upgrade to XK engines.!</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
    pulling the pistons out, Dick Vandermeyden came over with a bore mic and we 
    found a few things which I hadn't expected. The motor had .040 oversized pistons 
    and likely had after market sleeves. The sleeves were 7 inch's long vs the 
    7 1/8&quot; which is standard. We found that the crank had been ground .010 
    under and the piston bores had worn an additional .006 at maximum over the 
    .040 bore leaving the .064 thick sleeves pretty thin. So the sleeves will 
    need to be replaced. The crank had about .003 wear over the .010 grind so 
    it will get another .010 grind to be .020 under. </font></strong></tt></p>

</center>
<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I found a couple 
other minor things which will need to be replaced, the timing chain cover was 
corroded to the point of no return, and the inner valve chain gear mounting brackets 
had cracked and been welded up very poorly. Parts aren't to hard to find for XK 
motors as they were made roughly unchanged from 48-87.</font></strong></tt>

  block all stripped and ready to go out to the engine shop. It just needs a good 
  hot tanking.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are the 
  non factory .040 over pistons. Notice the lower oil ring. this is clearly not 
  a factory Hepolite piston, normal XK pistions don't have this lower ring. Not 
  sure what make the pistons are!</font></strong></tt></p>

  <img src="engine2_13_a_crop.jpg" height="458" width="411"> 
</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This crank 
  had already had a .010 grind and had more wear on top of it. I decided to swap 
  it out with a crank from a spare motor I found in my local junkyard. The new 
  crank will only have a .010 grind vs the .020 total grind required on this one. 
  The engine shop will cut out the oil plugs from the crank and flush out the 
  crud and then replug and balance. The timing chain cover to the right is trash.

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this picture 
  you can see some rust damage on the sleeves when the car sat up for some time. 
  The rings rust to the sleeve and then when the car is run again bad things happen. 
  These sleeves will be replaced so its not important. This is a good example 
  of one of the reasons you should always run cars vs letting them sit for years 
  without activity. Also note the rust around the water ports. This was later 
  determined to be about .050 deep and required some welding by the machine shop.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    bearing caps were pretty worn out, and of course will be replaced. Here you 
    can see the sleeves from the inside of the block. They are pretty thin at 
    this point with a .040 bore plus .003 nominal wear on top. It would be possible 
    to go to a .050 bore but that would mean the sleeves would be paper thin. 
    Best to resleeve.</font></strong></tt></p>

      freeze plugs weren't to hard to get out, but the inside of the water jacket 
      had forty years of rust and mineral deposits. I flushed about an inch of 
      sludge out of the block with the hose. I expect that this was mostly casting 
      sand that never got out of the engine from the factory. </font></strong></tt></p>

      main bearing caps were in fine condition, but look at the wear on the shells, 
      these were pretty far gone. Now that the engine is stripped and inspected 
      its off to the engine shop. I can now move on to other projects like the 
      Diff and IRS.</font></strong></tt></p>
