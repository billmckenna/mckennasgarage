<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The floor pans, 
cowl, and roof section work was another 60-80 hours of labor, done in Aug-Oct 
2002. </font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Floor pans installation 
went very smoothly. The hardest part was drilling a hole every inch for the welds. 
A good drill press is a bit help for this. I scribed each inch, so the welds would 
be exactly the same all the way around each pan. grinding down the spot welds 
was a little tricky in the front comers next to the firewall. I used a dremil 
tool in the tighter areas.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="newfloorpan3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Passenger side 
pan went in just as well as the driver's side. Quick and satisfying work I did 
have to sand off the primer around the welds first.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="newfloorpan4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320>
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'll strip the 
original junky primer later, before putting a second coat of epoxy primer down. 
For now I can fill the small dings and move on to bigger projects.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="newfloorpan5.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Passenger side 
pan from outside, nothing special to say for this picture.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="newfloorpan6.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both pans in one 
shot, with my previous restoration project a 1959 Cadillac in the background. 
On to the driver's side cowl.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="drsidecowl1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cowl was a 
somewhat challenging part to get correctly installed, both the front and rear 
edges and top and bottom edges must align. Several hours of alignment were needed 
to get a perfect fit. I drilled holes for every inch again for the front and rear 
welds, and stitched in the top and bottom. Vice grips again were a must to hold 
everything in place.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="drsidecowl2.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Front view before 
welding, everything is lined up and ready for simulated spot welding. Welding 
is the easy part, getting everything ready for welding takes allot of time.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="drsidecowl5.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Front view after 
welding ready to dress out all the welds and clean off the junk primer.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="drsidecowl10.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mostly finished 
job, ready for Lead. I actually leaded in both the cowls before fitting the doors. 
If I had it to do over I would skip this step and just do all the lead work at 
the same time. I ended up doing allot of the cowl work over as I blended in the 
doors and corrected the door gap.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="door_cowl2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Door and cowl are 
on but are very rough. The door gap is way off, however its manageable. Many hours 
of measuring, grinding, and lead work will be required to make the door gap perfect. 
I'll wait on this until after other major body work in the front of the shell 
is complete before doing the lead. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="oldroof4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
next problem area was the roof, its hard to know what caused the original damage 
but previous body men made a huge mess of the front roof stiffener. This is the 
part of the roof which has the rear view mirror and sun screen mounting hardware 
built into it. If I ever wanted to be able to have sun screens I had to replace 
this part. The part was spot welded in with dozens of welds and the roof had a 
bunch of dents and minor bends in difficult places to fix. Also the previous body 
worker had brazed patches in and ground the roof paper thin in several spots.</font></strong></TT></font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="oldroof6.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At first I planned 
on just drilling out all of the spot welds buying a new support and welding it 
in, I found after some research that this is one of the few sheet metal parts 
for E-types not produced by Martin Robey. Plan &quot;B&quot; was to find a roof 
section off of a wreck. I called around to 4-5 Jag centric junkyards and finally 
found one right here in California at Jaguar Heaven. Thanks to the many helpful 
suggestions from those on the E-Type Mail list!</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="oldroof8.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before I had a 
real plan for what to do about this area I cut the old support out. It was so 
badly mangled, I knew it would have to be replaced. After cutting it out I had 
planned on plug welding up all the holes, and just installing a new part, however 
the front of the roof was just too far gone to be fixed with my level of metal 
working skills, so I decided to cut the entire roof out and replace everything.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="newroof1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new roof section 
from Jaguar Heaven was in great shape, still had its original paint and very little 
surface rust. I paid about $400 for this part including shipping. It seemed a 
little high, but I was in no position to argue, as calls to 5 other yards had 
turned up nothing and this was the only one I could find.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="newroof3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other than a small 
dent in the center of the roof it was perfect. I had them cut it behind the joint 
where the front roof support joins the side. I'll get this part blasted before 
I start to work on it. No reason to try stripping all this rust by hand. The blaster 
will only charge $20 for this and his shop is 5 minutes from my office.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="newroof5.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the part 
of the roof which was destroyed on the old roof. Both sides were missing about 
two inches of metal right where the sunscreen mounting hole was. The compound 
curves and welded in bolts would have been nearly impossible to make without a 
pattern.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="template1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next step was 
making templates of the old roof. I made 2 for each side of the roof. One which 
had the angle of the roof line and the cut points, and a second which had the 
exact angle of the pillar cuts and level marked. these Templates were the only 
way I had to make sure the roof angle was exactly the same once I cut the roof 
off.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="roofcut5.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After measuring 
  everything about 20 times, I put a chalk line down across the top of the roof 
  and got my roto-zip out with a metal blade and cut the roof. No turning back 
  after this. It took about 3 blades in the Roto-Zip to get trough all the metal. 
  </font></strong></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="noroof1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I made sure I left 
a little more metal than I needed on the roof, which I could cut down later with 
a grinding wheel. No turning back after this cut. Its a one time shot too, so 
no amount of planning should be skipped.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="roofcut1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the new 
roof after sand blasting and marked up for cutting. The roof should be exactly 
the same, but I found that it wasn't quite. there was at least 1/16&quot; difference 
in the new roof and old, this in several areas, fortunately I managed get it to 
work. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="roofcut3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here the old roof 
and new roof ar side by side for comparison. The new roof is a bit larger than 
the old roof and will be fine tuned on the car using the templates as a guide.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="roofinstall2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here I'm trying 
to mate up the roof on the car. I had to go out and buy extra vice grips to hold 
all the parts together. The roof fitting process took an entire day from 8:00AM 
until 9:00PM before all the welds were finished. The fitting process is all trial 
and error. I must have put on and taken the roof off about a hundred times before 
everything was ready for welding. I use a magic marker to mark areas for cut down 
and then grind, then refit mark some more etc. etc. etc. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="roofinstall7.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here things are 
getting pretty close, I used washers and small nuts and bolts to keep the roof 
aligned in the center. Just cut notches in the roof, and put a set of two large 
flat washers on a bolt/nut. I used about 6 sets across the center. Later I'll 
weld up the notches after tack welds are in place. I ended up cutting too much 
metal off of the drivers side and had some fill welding to do, to do this kind 
of thing, use copper plates about 1/8&quot; on the back side of these areas to 
contain the weld and build up on both sides until the area is filled. Better welding 
shops and Eastwood have these copper weld backing plates. They are very handy 
when working on mangled auto bodies. Make sure not to weld in any area more than 
a couple seconds. Large sheets of steel like a roof are very prone to warp. I 
had some ugly warps in two spots which I ended up having to shrink out with my 
gas rig.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="roofinstall9.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All on, and ready 
for grinding, It will be several hours to cut down all the welds and patch up 
any pin holes etc.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="roofinstall10.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here you can see 
the rather large fill I had to make on the Driver's side weld. It will be invisible 
after grinding, but looks like heck now.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="roofinstall12.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here I'm in progress 
on the grinding, both sides will be dressed out, and low spots will be lead filled 
after the major low spots are filled and the high spots shrunk out. After this 
I'll skim the roof with plastic filler. I don't normally like to use plastic, 
but in a job like this there are too many minor high and low spots to fix without 
it, even after leading. The skim of plastic will be less than 1/16&quot; after 
sanding.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="finroof2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After plastic, 
and sanding the roof looks pretty close to perfect. Nothing the primer and block 
sanding won't fix. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="finroof7.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here you can see 
the first pass of plastic. I used 2 coats and sanded after each with an electric 
orbital sander with 36 grit paper followed by 80 Grit.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="finroof5.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The roof on the 
inside was also skimmed to make sure any low spots were filled and after sanding 
A quick coat of DP40 helped blend everything in. Its hard to tell it was ever 
done. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="finroof6.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This joint will 
need a little filler to be invisible. I'll also probably fill the holes in the 
roof rail and drill new ones when installing the new weather stripping track.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="finroof4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rear section 
  of the roof had a number of dings which were hammered out and a small amount 
  of plastic was used to fill both sides. This was mainly to cover pick hammer 
  marks etc. I use Ever coat plastic and have found it a great product.</font></strong></TT>
