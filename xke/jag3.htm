<B><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The engine 
pulling took about 12 hours over a weekend. This includes splitting the engine 
from transmission and putting the engine on the stand, but not engine tear down 
up to the point it is in the pictures.</font></strong></TT></B>

<B><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two 
common approaches to the E-Type engine pull, Top pulling and bottom. I hadn't 
ever seen bottom pulling of an engine so I did it the standard way. The engine 
fits very tightly in the sub frame making it a tedious job. You must take the 
pulleys and water pump off to clear the front of the sub frame, and the entire 
car needs to be at least one foot off the ground to allow the transmission to 
drop enough to get the engine out.</font></strong></TT></B> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="engpul9.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can see how steep 
the angle needs to be to get the engine out in this pic. I had a pair of XK lift 
loops bolted to the head. but only ended up using one and had to move it to the 
front head bolts to get the right lift pull point. I was surprised at how heavy 
the XK engine is. I don't have a scale, but would estimate it is about the same 
as a small block Chevy V8. Give or take 100 pounds.</font></B></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="engpul8.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm pretty sure 
  the engine had never been out of this car. It had at least 40 years of crud 
  on it and no evidence of previous pulling on the engine mounting hardware. The 
  later 4.2 Head was installed in the car without doubt. If I had to pull the 
  Engine again I'd probably remove the steering rack first to make a little more 
  front end clearance.</font></B></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="engpul13.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The transmission 
  with rear spring mounting pin clearly visible at the bottom. This car was one 
  of the first to have this arrangement with a spring type shock mount for the 
  transmission. It is listed in several books as the first FHC with this type 
  of mount. Also notice the drain cock for the crank case. This allows quick removal 
  of the antifreeze. Also notice the Speedo cable hanging below. The ninety degree 
  fitting on this easily gets snagged on the transmission tunnel on the way out. 
  I'd remove this first on the next engine pull.</font></B></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="noeng4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>  
<p><TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 63 Jag E-Type 
  less engine. You can see the waiting engine stand in the for ground. There is 
  no turning back from here. The engine pulling process took all day to complete, 
  however I'm sure if I had it to do again it would be quicker. Now that the engine 
  is out the tear down of the front suspension and sub frame will go quickly.</font></B></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="engpul18.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Up up and away, 
  Its been fun having you in there all these years, but its time to go get rebuilt. 
  I'm sure it will be at least a couple years before its back in. I'll strip the 
  engine down later, after all the body work is done. For now it goes on the stand 
  and will be stored away.</font></B></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="engpul22.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not a bad looking 
  power plant, but its seen better days. It was burning a little oil on startup 
  but had pretty good compression. The engine had about 143K miles on it by the 
  time I got it. Not bad for a late 40s engine design built in 62.</font></B></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="engpulmes1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remember that drain 
  cock I mentioned before. Guess who didn't think about using it. I spilled a 
  about a pint of fluid on the floor. Not a big deal, but could have been avoided. 
  Nothing a couple rags wont fix right up.</font></B></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="eng_trans1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting the transmission 
  off was a pretty smooth process, just pull the bolts and slide the splined shaft 
  out of the engine. Cutting all the grease off the transmission and engine was 
  a different story, several rags soaked in chemtool gave their all in this process.</font></B></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="engcamdet1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just love this shot 
  of the rear of the engine hanging on the crane. The oil lines are interesting. 
  The Rev counter Generator has already been removed. This is probably wasn't 
  required, but I did it as a precaution. Previous owner had destroyed the original 
  Rev Generator when replacing the head, by not fully threading the connector 
  cap into the end of the Cam. When the allen screws were tightened it pushed 
  the Generator out of the back of the housing. I replaced it before tear down. 
  This type of tach. is known to less than perfectly accurate, but its part of 
  the charm with E-types.</font></B></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="flywheel1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting those flywheel 
  bolts out was a bear. Even with a breaker bar and a home made tool to lock the 
  flywheel in place I took all the muscle I had to get them to break free. You 
  can't mount the engine on the stand until the wheel is off.</font></B></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="trans2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Moss Non Syncromesh 
  transmission in all its glory. It will get a full rebuild before going back 
  in the car, it was working fine before it was removed but better safe than sorry. 
  Its another item which will have to wait a year or two before it goes out for 
  rebuild.</font></B></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="engstand4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mounting the engine 
  on the stand is easy enough. I used four of the original transmission mounting 
  bolts to do this. Once it is on the stand it will go into a dry cool closet 
  in my garage.</font></B></TT></p>
