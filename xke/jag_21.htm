<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not a pretty 
  picture. The bonnet is waaaay out. Not sure how much of this is because of alignment, 
  but its not even close. When I first mounted the bonnet it wouldn't close because 
  the air ducts were mounted incorrectly and were hitting the sub frame and the 
  bonnet helpers. After I removed both air ducts I found this mismatch. The good 
  news (if there is any) is that the wings seem to have the correct contour. The 
  center section appears to be bowed, not sure how this happened.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Removing the 
  Air ducts was fairly simple, fortunately I didn't use Sika-Flex when putting 
  this together. The body seam sealer didn't work very well. I'm sure I would 
  have ended up doing this over anyway. Its best that I'm doing it now instead 
  of after all the paint work is finished. I'll have to sand the color and rocker 
  guard down to primer and rebuild the bonnet once I figure out what needs to 
  be reshaped. I took out the front supports and found that this helped get the 
  shape closer, but still other problems were going to have to be solved. I will 
  clean all these parts up, true up the mounting points on the lower bonnet tub 
  and put back together and do further fitting. </font></strong></TT></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I made an exact 
template to match the body shape with the cowl and used this to determine how 
much of the mismatch is due to fitting verses the actual shape of the center section. 
Once I have a good quality inside and outside template I can get a pretty close 
match with out having the bonnet on the car. I am hopeful that I won't have to 
remove the rear bonnet support and reshape it to meet the body contour.</font></strong></tt>

  <IMG SRC="bonnetfit2_4crop.jpg" HEIGHT=405 WIDTH=752> 
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I shimmed up the 
front of the bonnet as much as I could and determined that something is wrong. 
The lower bonnet tub is to far off to get a good fit, This tub will need to be 
cut apart and straightened out. The firewall looks straight, but even a small 
tweak in the firewall could translate into a major problem at the end of the fulcrum. 
I took many measurements and found that the firewall and sub frame were perfectly 
aligned (thank goodness). After this I formed the hypothesis that most of the 
problems were in the lower bonnet tub valance.</font></strong></TT>

</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I use a magnet 
  to hold the center section at proper alignment. It appears that there is a similar 
  amount of mismatch on each side. This doesn't add up to accident damage, If 
  this was caused by an accident it would most likely not be the same on both 
  sides. Maybe this is an alignment problem? more work will be required to determine 
  what is out.</font></strong></TT></p>

</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With no shims 
  in the front of the bonnet I have way to much gap at the rear. The sub frame 
  is all new so I'm pretty sure this is correct. Could it be that the tub on the 
  front of the bonnet is bent enough to produce this 1 inch gap? I noticed that 
  there is slightly less gap at the lower corners of the bonnet than in the center. 
  This would lead me to think that the nose is still lower than it should be.</font></strong></TT></p>

</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I guess that the 
wings can be brought in line by slightly bending the mounting edges on both the 
center section and the wing and some slight cutting on the inner wing supports. 
This can only be done after the center section is close to the proper shape. Its 
going to be a slow process but nothing that can't be done with enough time an 
effort. I am estimating a 3-4 month problem.</font></strong></TT>
