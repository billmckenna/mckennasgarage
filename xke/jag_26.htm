<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prep work is 
  the first order of business in painting. Before I even considered getting out 
  the paint, I went over the car with a fine tooth comb; found many small problems 
  which were corrected. I masked up everything next and found more problems and 
  fixed them, finally I went over everything with a tack cloth and 2 or 3 passes 
  with grease and wax remover. Even with all this I noticed several problems I 
  missed when I shot paint. Grrrr!</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before I put 
  out the panels for painting, I went over the entire booth with soapy water. 
  I mopped twice, and wiped down the walls with anti static spray. This is 50/50 
  mix of Alcohol and water.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before I got 
  to the point of shooting the major components of the car on the outside, I had 
  already done two batches of other parts including the inside of the doors and 
  bonnet, and the subframe and other small bits of hardware, like the heater vent 
  doors and nuts and bolts that would be on the subframe. This was helpful to 
  get the kinks out of my technique and the booth before doing the most critical 
  painting. The more I paint the better it gets. After each shoot of base and 
  clear I had to clean up the booth. Dust is amazing in that even in a more less 
  sealed booth it comes in on your clothes etc.</font></strong></tt></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once everything 
was as clean as possible I started shooting base. This picture is after the first 
coat of base. It really is important to do at least 2 complete coats of base. 
Notice the strip at the bottom right in this picture, its not quite covered after 
the first coat and is very easy to miss when inspecting. PPG DBC is nice stuff 
to shoot, it goes on thin and dries quickly, its easy.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here I am all 
  suited up and ready to shoot some paint The hood really works well except that 
  I have to change out the lenses between every couple tanks of paint. Its amazing 
  how much paint dust is floating around in the both and sticks to the suit.</font></strong></TT></p>

  <p align="left"><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here 
    I have two coats of base on the car and have caused a nasty run on the rear 
    fender. I had to sand this off and re-shoot 2 coats of base to fix it.</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The base on the 
bonnet came out pretty well. I had one water mark which needed to be sanded and 
blended in with more base but generally good no runs or dust nibs. In the foreground 
center of the picture you can se some slight dust which has settled on the dry 
paint. I wiped it off with my hand in the shape of a V. After every coat is dry 
make sure you wipe down with finial wipe to get this loose dust off.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The doors and 
  hatch also were pretty much flawless after two coats of base. I sanded a few 
  dust specs out between the first and second coat but no further touch up was 
  required. DBC goes on smooth with very little orange peel and dry's quickly 
  so runs weren't an issue in most places.</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shooting the lower 
parts of the body was a little problematic. On the sills it was easy enough to 
get down on the floor and look up under to make sure the paint was going on correctly, 
The trunk tub and lower bonnet however were tough. I had to lay on my back to 
see that the paint went on without any thin spots or runs.</font></strong></TT>

</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All of the flat 
surfaces were easy to shoot and get smooth. No orange peel or dust. I found that 
the first 2-3 minutes of shooting are the most critical. This is when you have 
new paint in the gun and possible minor adjustment issues. Also the over spray 
and dust from painting seems to help knock down any dust in the air after a some 
painting. This seems especially true with clear coat. The Clear is very sticky 
and slows down any dust which may be on the floor or the suit.</font></strong></TT>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting the 
  base smooth with minimal dust and zero runs or problems is the most important 
  thing in a base/clear paint job! The clear can be pretty messed up and be sanded 
  out or recoated. but if you have base coat problems its not going to get better 
  once the clear is on unless you sand the panel out and redo both base and clear. 
  Things are looking pretty much the way they should after two coats of base.</font></strong></tt></p>

</CENTER>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bonnet 
  also is just about perfect now with two coats of base. After every coat I went 
  over the panel with grease and wax remover to get any dry spray dust off. Also 
  this was a good time for inspection. I found several dust nibs and hairs etc 
  that needed to be lifted or sanded out.</font></strong></tt></p>
  <CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="paintjob2_37crop.jpg" HEIGHT=455 WIDTH=579> 
</CENTER>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After three 
  coats of PPG 2055 clear things are starting to shine, you can see some slight 
  orange peel and dust in the clear. I found it hard to keep absolutely zero texture 
  in the paint. Even if you over reduce it 10% and lay it on thick letting it 
  run and sag here and there, some texture is hard to avoid. Possibly a clear 
  coat gun like a Sata 2000. This will be easy to sand out later.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stacking on 
  the clear took all afternoon. I think 3 coats on the entire outside of the car 
  was about 1.25 gallons of clear. Or five quart sized batches through the gun.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <IMG SRC="paintjob2_43crop.jpg" HEIGHT=401 WIDTH=548> 
</CENTER>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here its easy 
  to see some texture in the spray up by the blister. I had a massive run on the 
  hood as well. I will try to knock the top of the run off with a razor blade 
  and then sand it out with a hard foam block. I have no idea how much sanding 
  and buffing this bonnet will take but I'm guessing about two months of labor 
  if nothing really bad happens.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <IMG SRC="paintjob2_46crop.jpg" HEIGHT=388 WIDTH=488> 
</CENTER>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a good 
  example of some orange peel, a nasty run, and some dry spray. I even have a 
  dust nib to get out. With 3 or 4 coats of clear its hard to keep some bad things 
  from happening. Especially if you are a beginner painter like me. Fortunately 
  clear coat can be sanded and buffed out. </font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    The roof was mostly ok despite this bad photo. It will sand and buff out pretty 
    well. I will probably put 2-3 more coats of clear on the outside of the car 
    after I sand out the first 3. Experts tell me this is the best way to get 
    a show finish. 3 coats of clear, block sand out and 2 or 3 more coats of clear 
    and block sand then buff.</font></strong></tt></p>
