<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After roughly 
  3 years of toil, the rebuild is underway. Putting the car back together goes 
  quickly relative to the other work, but is very stop and go. Once you have everything 
  you think you need, you'll find that there are always things you have forgotten. 
  I'm guessing everything on this web page is no more than 20 hours of labor.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I started by 
  putting in new stainless heater pipes, and riveting on the blanking plate for 
  the brake booster if the car was RHD. I put on any of the small firewall parts 
  that were easy to bolt up, and unlikely to limit access when doing later work, 
  the bonnet latch parts, RHD brake blanking plates, Wiper motor etc. Next came 
  the Sub frame. This went without issue. The only thing to note is the threads 
  on the firewall were full of paint and needed to be chased out. </font></strong></tt></p>

  the car from the Rolling stand I put it up on Jack stands but made sure to paint 
  each stand with clean rubber tool handle coating. This is available at most 
  hardware stores and is just the thing to help prevent paint damage on the rails. 
  High jack stands makes some nice storage in my space limited garage.</font></strong></tt></p>

    had already pre assembled the Brake booster and bolted it in next, I also 
    ran the fuel and brake lines under the body and started putting in vacuum 
    lines. Notice I have the Heater valve in here, but its upside down. I had 
    a number redo's while putting things back together, since this is my first 
    time assembling an E-type.</font></strong></tt></p>

  and used it in any visible areas.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    bought a set of letter and number punches and created a new ID plate, based 
    on a blank jaguar plate from one of the usual suppliers. The repro ID plates 
    aren't exactly correct. They are slightly smaller and the writing isn't exactly 
    the same as the original. Fortunately <a href="http://inetogether.net/jaguar/">Mark 
    DeLong</a> A fellow E-type lover who is restoring a 63 OTS, took it upon himself 
    to get a batch of correct name plates made up. They are the right size and 
    have the correct original oils listed. I haven't installed mine yet but will 
    do this soon. This incorrect plate will go in the scrap bin. Thanks Mark!</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting the right 
run of the vacuum, brake and clutch lines took some time, I had to look at various 
pictures from other cars to see what the most common layout was in 1963. The garbage 
can is quickly filling up with empty zip lock bags as parts go back on the car. 
Its a good feeling!</font></strong></tt>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Front suspension 
parts came together pretty quickly, This is heavy work and a good brass or plastic 
hammer is helpful to get parts like this installed. Notice the blue paint on the 
bolt heads. I re plated all of the original hardware and reused it. before installing 
it I sprayed all the bolt heads body color, and then touched them up with paint 
after installing. Little details like this will hopefully save me points with 
the judges.</font></strong></tt>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Its starting to 
look like a car again. I have a constant battle keeping the paint from getting 
damaged. I am afraid to leave the car uncovered more than a few hours. It is super 
easy at this point to damage paint in the shop, lots of tools and parts moving 
around in a confined area, is a receipt for disaster.</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Setting up 
  the torque bars and getting the front shocks installed is a project which is 
  worth discussing. First make the correct setup tool as described in the shop 
  manual. This attaches where the shock normally goes. Then adjust the torque 
  arms so that the bolts will line up in the rear mounting plates. This is a quick 
  job. The real problem is compressing the torque bar to get the upper and lower 
  A-arms to come together and then to get both arms to come up enough to get the 
  shock installed. I used a couple of turn buckles with loops on the end connecting 
  to the shock bolts to get the A-arms to come together. There is a serious amount 
  of energy stored in the torque arms and it was all the 3/8&quot; turn buckles 
  could take to bring the arms together.</font></strong></tt></p>

</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bringing both 
  arms to get the shock installed was the biggest problem. I had to buy a large 
  lifting hook and put it over the top suspension shaft then attach this to the 
  turn buckle. The other end went on the sway bar mounting bolt. The torque was 
  so great I had to weld the 3/8&quot; mild steel loop ends together so it wouldn't 
  stretch. Its hard to describe this without a picture, but the Turnbuckle rig, 
  and associated parts are common hardware store items. </font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The steering 
  rack and sway bar linkage went in smoothly. I put a level on each rotor and 
  adjusted from the center point in the steering rack with the tie arms so the 
  track of the wheels would be roughly straight. I will fine tune this after the 
  car is back on the road.</font></strong></tt></p>

</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of the 
  small parts went together without any notable hardship. The wiper rack was an 
  exception. I thought somehow this would go into the car in one piece. Wrong. 
  I ended up taking it apart and reassembling it in inside the cowl. Not an easy 
  or fun job. </font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last but not 
  least, for this page, I installed Dynamat Extreme as is commonly done these 
  days. It is easy to work with, I cut it to fit with a razor knife. Mine didn't 
  come out as pretty as I would have liked, but it will do the job and makes the 
  doors feel like a big American tank when they close! It used just over one large 
  bulk pack. I probably will put an extra coat on the inside of the transmission 
  tunnel, just to keep the heat down on the inside of the car.</font></strong></tt></p>
