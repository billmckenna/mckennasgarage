<TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Start date was Feb 
22nd 2002 for tear down. Tear down was about 3 months. Probably an average of 
20 hours a week worth of work, so about 300 hours to get the car torn down to 
a shell and sent it out for blasting.</FONT></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With any Car restoration 
there are literally thousands of parts to inventory and track. I used digital 
pictures to document all the original details. Hardware and small parts were put 
in plastic bags and numbered. I used a spreadsheet to inventory all bags. Ended 
up with about 450 Bags of parts.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The interior was the 
first to go. The car had very little of the original interior, however I documented 
as much of the original interior as possible and saved everything. The rubber 
weather stripping was completely rotten. Things move pretty quickly during the 
tear down. It was about a 3 month process working mostly on weekends to strip 
the car down to base components. Storage of parts was the biggest challenge, I 
ended up with about 30 numbered boxes. I kept a manifest of the contence of each 
box. All the original interior material and rubber was saved as reference when 
reinstalling. Note the incorrect fuel pump on the trunk wall, This was a short 
term fix to get the car going.</font></B></TT>

</CENTER>
<TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The chrome and all 
exterior hardware was the next to go. All of this will be replaced or re plated. 
The rear deck lid was in nice shape and however all of the glass was scratched 
and will most likely not be used. The deck lid channel was rusted out as was the 
trunk floor. Based on what I've seen, this is the most common area to rust on 
FHCs. Fortunately the sheet metal is all available.</font></B></TT>

</CENTER>

  <B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dash stripping is pretty 
  much done here, and only the wiring harness remains. The harness will be replaced. 
  Various hack jobs had been done over the years to support radios etc. The Transmission 
  tunnel is dirty but in good shape as are the floor boards. I'll replace the 
  foot wells but the rest of the floor is solid with minimal rust or damage.</font></B> 
<CENTER>
  <p><IMG SRC="windowsillrust1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></p></CENTER>  
<B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Here is a close up of the rear window frame. 40 years 
  of water have done wonders for the trim strip. Fortunately the metal under it 
  is in pretty good shape. Lead was loaded here as part of the roof seam, and 
  it helped protect the steel under this strip. Unfortunately this was not the 
  case with the truck tub and foot wells etc.</font> </TT></B> </p>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="origregulat1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The serial number plate 
is well faded. The car still bears its 1963 California registration tag and the 
made in England tag. The engine and transmission numbers match except for the 
head which was replaced. I found a NOS 3.8 Liter head which will be used in the 
rebuild.</font></TT></B></p> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="suspen1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'll need to find an original 
Lucas generator eventually to replace this late model Ford alternator. Its pretty 
clear in this picture just how tired the car really was. The original Caps for 
the brake fluid tanks were replaced by plastic juice bottle lids. The heater box 
is tired, and will need a good bead blasting.</font></TT></B></p> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="origpump1.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original Lucas 2FP fuel pump
gave up the ghost many year ago and was full of crud. I bought a core and rebuilt this 
pump. It appears the weak link in these is the brushes.  A exhaustive search and discussion
on the XKE mail list turned up no rebuild kit for these, so I went to my local parts store 
and found brushes which were close to original as possible. After some slight mods the
pump was put back together and is working like a champ.</font></TT></B></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="radiator1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Previous owner had 
the radiator re cored, this radiator isn't correct. I will need to research the 
correct 63 era radiator. The bonnet mounting frame is also tweaked and will be 
replaced. along with the sub frame. I'll salvage the picture frame as it has the 
original Serial number stamped into it.</font></TT></B></p> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="strippedfw1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dirt and grease are the 
order of the day. The original metallic silver blue paint is pretty funky after 
40 years on the road. The Sub frame looked good during tear down, it had only 
minimal rust and no cracks, unfortunately the driver's side frame was bent inward 
about 2-3 degrees so both sides will be replaced.</font></TT></B></p> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="vacumeboot1.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I took hundreds of shots 
of all the detail areas and will compare to other S1 E-Types when putting the 
car back together. I don't know how restorers got by before digital cameras. All 
these parts will be sent to professionals for complete rebuild. </font></TT></B></p> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="wharnes2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The under hood wiring harness 
is trashed, many mods had been done to keep the car on the road. The entire mess 
will be saved for reference, but a new harness will be a must. The battery box 
area is well rusted, but fortunately nothing structural.</font></TT></B></p> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="frontsusp1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't think anyone ever 
replaced the shocks on this car. The suspension appears to have been untouched 
from the factory. I used several gallons of Chemtool to get these parts clean 
and will send them out for plating as required. I was surprised overall at how 
easily everything came apart compared to other cars I've worked on, California 
cars just have an easy life verses those from northern states.</font></TT></B></p>
