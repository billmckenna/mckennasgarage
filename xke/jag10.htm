<BR></H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The door and body 
leading process is very slow work. Didn't really track the exact hours as it was 
part of the body work process, but at least 20 hours per door and another 40 hours 
to lead the rest of the body. This car needed allot of lead this work was done 
between July and Nov 2002</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The door gap on 
both doors was pretty messy when the lead work started. A good bit of leveling 
work will be needed first on the door and the body of the car, also door aligning 
is a must. The hinges must be installed and the latch. Get the door roughly in 
the correct position first so that the door opens and closes freely and the rear 
edge of the door meets the crease in the fender perfectly.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="dooralign2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here its easy to 
see that the door gap is off. I took the doors off and did allot of measuring 
on both sides of the car and on both doors to determine what was off. It turned 
out that in this case the door skin was about 2-3 mm to long. I quickly fixed 
this with the grinder and had to do some touch up welding to fill the edges where 
the door edge cut through.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="notebook1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I precisely measured 
the door and body in about ten different places, and compared notes. I found that 
the body was the same on both sides down to 1-2 mm while the doors, which I had 
skinned were different as much as 3-4 mm. So I had to file down the doors to make 
them fit perfectly. Fortunately the doors were both larger than they should be 
and not to small. The reason for this I'm sure is that when I was folding over 
the door skin I didn't have a method to exactly force the crease in the skin in 
a particular place. Just folding over the skin yields inconsistant results. The 
process to correct this was slow and required many trial fittings of each door. 
Do one door at a time vs trying to do both doors in steps.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead3.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After I had 
  trimmed down the areas which were clearly largeer than the door opening, marked 
  the door alignment as closely as possible when the latch was properly set. I 
  adjusted the latch a number of times to get the best fit, as well as fine tuning 
  the hinges. After all this was done I put down tinning butter and started to 
  lead in the rear door seam. After looking at many close ups of S1 E-Types, I 
  opted for a 3 mm gap all around with a slightly larger gap on the front door 
  seam. Don't want to risk that the front edge will scrape on the finish as the 
  door opens This clearance is pretty tight even with a 3.5-4 mm gap. I'll need 
  to watch the filler and paint build up on these seams and make sure that it 
  doesn't narrow these gaps.</font></strong></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The door leading 
process is very slow going. I estimate that I put about 20 hours into getting 
each door. The door area uses quite a bit of lead too. I used around 5-6 pounds 
of lead in each of the door jams to get the 3 mm gap I was looking for. Most of 
this lead ended up on the floor after filing.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To get all the 
edges perfect a small amount of lead skimmed on the door as well as the body. 
I got most of the low spots on the edge of the door up with a pick hammer, but 
for the low spots which were behind the edge and other small dents lead was required. 
I leaded the door first and then put it on the car for filing. File both the body 
and the door at the same time for a perfect contour, and don't worry about saving 
lead. Any extra lead will be filed off on the floor and can be re melted for later 
use. If I did this over I would probably skip this step and just use plastic or 
high build primer to fix these problems. They were pretty minor dents and I wasted 
allot of time tying to get the body perfect even though I was going to be having 
other ways to fix these problems in later stages of the job.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead22.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here the rear 
door gap is coming along pretty well. The gap still needs some filing to be 3 
mm its about 2 here. Remember there will be paint on top of this which will build 
up some on both edges, about 1 mm. This shot was taken before buffing so the lead 
and body still looks pretty dull. This is the way things look during filing.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead9.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here the gap on 
the front of the door is about right. the door edge is still a little crooked, 
but its about 3.5-4 mm. The bottom gap is still less than 2 mm This will need 
additional filing on the door bottom and lead on the sill. Also note that the 
filing of the front edge has caused some of the lead to peel off. This is a spot 
where the tinning wasn't good. The lead peels right off. Always make sure the 
tinning is solid before paddling in the lead.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead10.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here the lead work 
is just getting underway on the bottom of the door. The gap is first filled almost 
up to the bottom of the door and then filed out to the correct level and contour.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead5.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here the upper 
edge of the door has the right curve and gap, but the level of the door is lower 
than the edge of the body with the lead filed down. The door will be removed and 
the shell pick hammered up to make the level perfect. Looks worse than it really 
is in this angle shot.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead18.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This shot is after 
some lifting of the edge but still a slight problem in the corner. I'll hammer 
some more on this before its done. Notice the joint on the front edge by the windscreen 
pillar, this will need some major work to grind down the body and patch in some 
new sheet metal fixing the contour. This is the way it came from the factory as 
best I could tell. The other side of the car met flush with the door skin, so 
I'll fix this to be the same. It will ruin the lead work, but I can hopefully 
localize the damage and patch the lead work quickly.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead17.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here the gap and 
contour are about right, you can notice the gradual expanding of the gap on the 
front edge of the door. Many pictures of these cars from the factory show this 
slightly wider front gap.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead13.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rear door gap is 
about right now. still some minor sanding to do, but this is after scotch brite 
dressing and is nearly done.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead15.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bottom edge is 
pretty close too. some small work still to be done in the front corner. The corners 
always require special attention.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead14.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rear of the bottom 
of the door is just about right, some blemishes in the lead under the door show 
up but these will be buffed out or primed out in later phases of the paint process.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorlead11.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One door down and 
one to go. This took over 20 hours. No wonder they don't build cars like this 
any more.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sidelead5.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the first 
body problems page I have a before picture of this damage. It was welded up first 
and then leaded, will be impossible to detect.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sidelead7.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a close 
up of one of the patches behind the doors after lead. Its almost impossible to 
tell there was ever a problem before paint is even applied. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sidelead1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Its easy to see 
now all the dents in the fenders which needed to be filled. Lead is really nice 
for this kind of filling although much slower to apply and work down than Plastic. 
Don't know exactly what went on with this car, but it wasn't easy on the sheet 
metal. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sidelead4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a finished 
roof section seam. Will be invisible soon. The next things to do will be more 
body work on the bonnet, followed by replacement of the trunk tub and rear deck. 
Any questions or corrections feel free to email to me at the address on the bottom 
of each page.</font></strong></TT>
