<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a shot 
after the second coat of high build primer. things are looking better, but still 
far from perfect. It is just amazing the high and low spots that a long board 
will find if given half a chance.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I couldn't maintain 
the trunk tub seam all the way up to the bumper and get a good finish. I have 
noticed that many factory E-types have lead in this seam and are similar. Not 
sure how the JCNA judging would look at something like this. Guess I'll find out 
some day.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This will be the 
last coat of high build on the inside of the body. I shot two coats of high build, 
two coats of epoxy primer on the inside. </font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things are shaping 
up nicely. Its hard to imagine that this will soon be ready for color. I didn't 
take any pictures of the sanded out second coat of primer, but there were a number 
of problems I didn't expect. The third coat should be a charm.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the third 
coat of primer going on. I didn't want over spray on the areas which weren't getting 
a 3rd coat of primer so I masked them up. In total the three coats of primer on 
the outside and two coats on the inside consumed 1.5 Gallons of PPG NCP 280. This 
is a 2 part paint with hardener/reducer mixed 2:1 so in the end each gallon produced 
1.5 gallons of paint. So in pure volume I put 2.25 gallons of paint on the car.

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The third 
  coat of primer really went on smooth, almost no orange peel and only a couple 
  runs. I like to shoot a light coat first to form a sticky film over the body 
  and then come back in a few minutes and lay down one thick coat. I use a Devilbiss 
  Finishline paint gun which has been perfect for shooting primer. I like to adjust 
  the fan control and use a wide pattern for the mist coat, and then narrow the 
  pattern for the heavy coat. Its really important to have good light when shooting. 
  I shot all of my paint in an open garage with a fan pushing dust out and natural 
  sun light as much as possible on the work area.</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was a shot 
where the flash didn't go off due to the bright background, but it does show how 
well the third coat of primer went down.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This picture also 
shows the third coat, I painted the 3rd coat on the bonnet inside first and later 
will shoot the top of the bonnet after finial fitting it to the car. I'm sure 
there will be some work required to get the alignment perfect and I'll need to 
do some minor fill and paint work in the process of fitting.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the third 
  coat of primer avoided sanding again until the doors and bonnet are installed. 
  The next step was to mask up the bottom of the car and shoot 3M rocker guard. 
  Rocker guard comes in a one time use disposable can and shoots like paint. Unfortunately 
  you must buy a special gun to shoot it. The gun was $70 which I thought was 
  a bit high, but the results are worth it.</font></strong></TT></p>

  <IMG SRC="bodyshultz_12crop.jpg" HEIGHT=313 WIDTH=509> 
</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I used two 
  cans exactly of rocker guard on the bottom of the car and wheel wells. Don't 
  waste a drop or you'll run out. If I did this over I probably would use three 
  cans just for good measure. Rocker guard dissolves with grease and wax remover 
  so make sure you are close to painting when you shoot it. You should avoid wiping 
  down of this product before shooting color. On a positive note if you make a 
  few masking mistakes its really easy to clean up the mistakes, just wipe down 
  with grease and wax remover and its good as new.</font></strong></TT></p>

</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wheel wells 
  in the bonnet got the same treatment. I extended the Schultz across the bottom 
  of the bonnet in the rail where the bonnet hinges mount. Rocker guard dries 
  quickly and could be coated with paint in as little as an hour. I waited over 
  night just to be safe.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ready for Color! 
  During the this time I was working with several paint shops to find the right 
  paint brand and color. After much discussion with paint experts, I decided to 
  use PPG Deltron DBC and PPG 2055 clear. I had three possible target colors. 
  Dark Green Opalescent, Dark Blue Opalescent, and Maroon Opalescent. Matching 
  colors to 1963 color chips was a challenge. Most paint shops weren't setup to 
  reference 1960s era ICI paint codes. My better had finial color decision authority, 
  but we decided on the color only after I ordered pints of the 3 target colors 
  along with chips which we could use to make the finial decision. If you are 
  doing this kind of thing for an XKE and need help email me or post to the e-type 
  mail list.</font></strong></TT>
