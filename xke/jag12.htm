<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bonnet 
  was a real mess on this car, many small dents from earlier body work which were 
  poorly fixed etc. I metal prepped for at least 50 hours to get the major high 
  and low spots out before I even started to skim with plastic. There were dozens 
  of holes drilled which needed to be welded up, and several areas that needed 
  to be cut out and patched. The lower hood section was first to get attention 
  and after welding and beating out dents it got a skim of plastic seen here.

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a couple 
  skims of plastic I used a surfacing glaze and then sanded out with 150 grit 
  paper before shooting DP40</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fender on 
the left hand side of the car was pretty badly damaged but wasn't a complete loss. 
It took a weekend or two to get the front fenders dressed and ready for primer.</font></strong></TT>

  <IMG SRC="frontfenders1_crop.jpg" HEIGHT=451 WIDTH=261> 
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I skimmed about 
3 thin coats of plastic on, block sanded down as many high spots as I could find 
then put a coat of pin hole filling glaze on. This was sanded this down with 150 
grit and before painting. Make sure you use plenty of grease and wax remover to 
get all the filler's natural oil out of the pours and to eliminate all dust before 
painting.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Work in Progress, 
  this is where it all happens. space is very limited so I have to do allot of 
  planning to make sure I don't get myself into a corner which is hard to work 
  out of (so to speak). I'll be glad when the bonnet is back together as it will 
  create space I can use for other projects.</font></strong></TT> </p>

</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The center 
  section was a real mess. I really debated replacing it along with one of the 
  wings and supports, however some research told be that the center section alone 
  was over a thousand dollars so I thought I'd take a stab at repairing it. Previous 
  body men had beaten the crap out of the left side. Several patches had to be 
  cut in, I really would have cut more of this out and replaced it if I'd had 
  an English wheel. I estimate that about 40 hours of work was required.</font></strong></TT></p>

</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Close up of 
  the damage really says allot. Fortunately only one side was mangled. I really 
  improved my hammer and dolly skills by the time I was done. I also used a torch 
  in many areas to heat planish out really nasty spots. The combination of heat 
  and hammer and dolly really smoothes and shrinks steel if its done right. </font></strong></TT></p>

</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I made a mistake 
here. Once I had all the dents leveled as close as I could with the hammer, dolly 
and files. I skimmed the inside of the bonnet with plastic filler, This turned 
out to be a bad way to go. After I had the inside perfect I started on the outside 
and found a number of high spots that needed to be dinged down during block sanding. 
When I did this the inside plastic cracked and had to be replaced. So lesson learned 
do the outside first and then skim the inside where high and lows are less noticeable 
and a skim of plastic is easier to blend in.</font></strong></TT>

</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a coat of 
paint its looking allot better. Not perfect, but the high build primer should 
take care of any minor problems I missed. I found later that in fact I should 
have spent more time working out the highs and lows during this stage, another 
lesson learned. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER>
  <p><IMG SRC="hoodprimer4_crop.JPG" HEIGHT=233 WIDTH=398> </p>
  <p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A single 
    coat of primer doesn't quite cover up the plastic filler under it, however 
    once the bonnet is back together I'll shoot two or three coats of high build 
    primer and do another round of block sanding.</font></strong></TT> </p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The inside of the 
center section after I reworked the plastic and paint after cracking it by dinging 
out high spots. Everything is ready for re-assembly now.</font></strong></TT>

  <IMG SRC="bonnet1_2crop.jpg" HEIGHT=208 WIDTH=429>
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Putting the bonnet 
back together was fairly challenging. I started with the wings and lower hood 
section. All this went in smoothly. Alignment was hard at times and I'll have 
to do a small amount of dressing in the front to get everything perfect. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="bonnet1_003.jpg" HEIGHT=290 WIDTH=386>
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I didn't take 
enough pictures of this part of the rebuild but the short story is that getting 
the air ducts installed was the hardest part. They fit tightly into the nose of 
the bonnet and have lots of holes which must be aligned in the supports. Next 
time I do a bonnet I will start by fitting these before I put the wings or lower 
tub in place. In the end I managed to get it all done, but this took about 20 
hours of fitting and refitting. Later I found that all of this work was a waste. 
I ripped out the ducts several times once I found the bonnet didn't fit correctly 
on the car. See later pages.</font></strong></TT>
