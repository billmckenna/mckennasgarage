<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The last step 
  before shooting color, This process took about 20 hours of work, and 2 weeks 
  of waiting for custom chrome.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few of the 
  tools of the trade, in addition to having the rubber gaskets for all chrome 
  and a good selection of washers and correct bolts, I used a 4 inch angle grinder 
  and a ninety degree die grinder to shape the edges of each part. Small work 
  was done with a dremel tool. </font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The rear tail 
  lights were fairly close to the right body shape as I had fitted them previously 
  when I leaded in the back of the car. I did find that one of the mounting brackets 
  had to be cut off and re welded in about an eighth of an inch further over. 
  This happened because I didn't use the correct #10 32 tpi screws when test fitting. 
  Another lesson learned, don't cut corners on hardware when test mounting chrome.</font></strong></TT></p>

</CENTER>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is what 
  the area looked like before moving the bracket. I taped up the entire area with 
  two layers of masking tape before fitting any chrome. Don't cut corners on masking 
  areas while fitting parts. The tape saved me dozens of scratches. Especially 
  when cutting the bracket off and re welding it in place. One slipped screw driver 
  or a bit of weld spray means a re shoot of primer and tons of sanding.</font></strong></tt></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Because of the 
major rear end replacement required on this car, custom bumpers were made to fit 
the new body contour. Large amounts of lead was required to blend the back of 
the car into the angle matching the tail light housings. Standard bumpers were 
way off. Jorge Cervera in San Diego made really nice custom bumpers based on templates 
I made of the back of the car. He knocked up custom jigs based on templates and 
formed bumpers which were fairly close. After he roughed out the bumpers he sent 
them to me for fitting, I cut them down to fit the car and mailed them back to 
him for finial dressing and plating. </font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After getting 
  the bumpers from Jeorge, I masked off the rear of the car and started fitting, 
  Even with custom parts the rear bumpers required a good bit of fine tuning, 
  I had to relocate the mounting plates which were only tack welded in, and cut 
  down the inside edge to get a correct fit. On one side I had to bend the bumper 
  slightly to get dead on.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The front bumpers 
  went on pretty smoothly, In this picture the Left hand bumper is getting close. 
  A small amount of space is acceptable since the rubber body gasket will take 
  up the space. I found that about one eighth of an inch was about all you could 
  expect to fill with the rubber without having a noticeable dimple or gap.</font></strong></TT></p>

</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things are getting 
close here. I need to put some washers on the bumpers to get them to the right 
angle, right now both are drooping giving the mouth a funny snaggle toothed look. 
Getting the center bar in was a challenge. I had to cut small amounts out of the 
elbows and weld in a new nut with case hardened threads. The mild steel has a 
tendency to strip if you cross thread it at all. will eventually get them re plated. 
I should have gotten all the parts un plated plated from Jeorge. Live and learn.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The left side 
  bumper is dialed in nicely now. I find that when mounting the bumpers with the 
  rubber trim, masking tape is the best thing to hold the rubber in place while 
  fitting. Just tape the rubber to the bumper and fit away. Once all the bolts 
  are snugged down strip off the masking take and your done.</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another shot of 
the front bumper I masked up any chrome which I wasn't planning on having re plated 
to protect it. Here I have a pretty good gap along the bonnet and will install 
the rubber gasket next. You'd be surprised how much refitting is required when 
you put the rubber gasket on. I had to go as far as enlarge holes and even move 
mounting brackets on one bumper.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is an interesting 
shot of the rear bumper mounted without the over rider. I had some minor fitting 
problems with the over riders since these bumpers were custom made. Jeorge offered 
to fit them for me so I sent the bumpers and over riders back together and will 
let him dial them all in together be for plating. My trusty 4 inch angle grinder 
is in the background. Don't know how I'd live without that thing.</font></strong></TT>

</CENTER>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ok that's it 
  for fitting chrome, the other parts went on fairly smoothly. I fitted the window 
  frames on the doors, and installed the weather stripping channel before painting. 
  Now that the chrome is complete I'll tear the car down and give it a good bath 
  with soap and water. Grinding and welding near the car had covered everything 
  in a thin film of dirt and oil. Next I'll build a paint booth and finial prep 
  the car for painting. Won't be long now until the color and clear are on for 
  good! </font></strong></tt></p>
