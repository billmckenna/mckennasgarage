  <h2> <font color="#330033">Building a powder coating station</font><br>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Powder coating 
  aah yes the final solution to the age old problem of how to paint small or not 
  so small parts and make them last! I initially planned on sending out all of 
  the powder coating until I started getting prices and realized it would cost 
  big bucks to get it all done. So as usual I got on the net learned a bit on 
  how to do powder coating at home and here is what I came up with. Building the 
  oven station took about 10 hours of work not including all the time spent rounding 
  up an old oven.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, score 
  an old electric oven! Depending on where you live and how much construction 
  or remodeling is going on, this can be easy or hard. For me it was fairly easy 
  to find an oven as we had some work going on at the house and several contractors 
  involved who had other jobs where ovens were coming out. This baby was free 
  and worked perfectly, All it needed was a new heating element and a good cleaning.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This unit was 
  a dual oven microwave model from GE circa 1986. I didn't really need the microwave 
  taking up space so I removed it. Fortunately GE didn't integrate the microwave 
  and oven electronics extensively. It was just a matter of unplugging the microwave 
  bits and removing the screws that attached it. I had to cut a couple wires but 
  no serious electronics hacking was needed. The strip down took about an hour, 
  and I saved all the hardware and sheet metal to use building the station.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the 
  electronics mess, on the left are all the parts of the microwave heading for 
  the trash, on the right is the oven unit. I have to say GE was making pretty 
  high quality stuff in this era! All the modules were made for easy replacement 
  and lots of hand labor was needed to assemble the oven/microwave. It was pretty 
  well engineered for its time.</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All cleaned 
  up and ready to get busy! I used the MIG welder to build the station, Once you 
  get into welding, its hard to go back to wood or screws. It is so quick and 
  easy to frame up something in steel once all the parts are cut. </font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    took measurements of the oven box, got out a tape measure and a straight edge 
    and figured out what I wanted to build. I am going to put a small rolling 
    stand on the bottom to get the oven up to a reasonable working level, and 
    build a powder coating booth on top. After deciding on the dimensions I made 
    a parts list and went to my local steel yard. The yard did all the cuts for 
    me so all I had to do was finial fitting and welding. The materials about 
    $180 including wheels and spray paint, not bad but steel is much more expensive 
    than a few years ago, probably about 2 times the cost per pound as when I 
    built the rotisserie.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First I framed 
up a 16&quot; x 20&quot; box on the bottom, as a basis for the rolling stand. 
I welded this directly to the mild steel skids on the bottom of the oven.</font></strong></tt>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next 
    I framed up the stand and used some of the old sheet metal left over's from 
    the microwave to make a bottom, not pretty, but who is going to see it!</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A little more 
welding of pre cut sheet metal and wheels and it was ready to roll, The cart put 
the oven about 20&quot; off the floor and gives me a nice place to store powder 
coating supplies.</font></strong></tt>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After getting 
the cart finished I framed up a steel box on top which will become a powder coating 
cab. Powder coating is very messy so you need some way to contain the powder. 
I used the mounting hardware from the microwave to make skids for the cab and 
attached it to the oven in a similar manner as the microwave had been attached. 
I can slide the cab off the oven for storage but once its locked in place it will 
stay put.</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The booth is 
  all framed up now, I left a 20&quot; opening in the back for a box fan, this 
  proved to be a bad design. The powder is so light and fine that even on low 
  speed the fan sucks the powder out of the cab. I even had a paint filter on 
  the fan but it didn't even slow down the powder. Lesson learned, no fan for 
  a powder coating booth.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I primed and 
  painted the sheet metal with rattle cans and added mounts for the electrics. 
  Almost ready to go now!</font></strong></tt></p>

</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All ready to 
  go. The fan was a mistake but I'll remove it and put some cardboard over the 
  opening eventually. I had to add a 220 volt outlet into the garage to run the 
  oven. Typically these run on a 20 Amp, but I tied it into an existing 50 Amp 
  circuit. not to code but it works. A 20 foot extension and the plug and outlet 
  was about $60. The powder coating gun was $75, I spent about $130 on powder 
  coat and supplies so Total investment is about $450. About the cost of one good 
  batch of powder coating done professionally. </font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ready to rock 
  and roll, I'll discuss the process for powder coating on the next page! Powder 
  coating is similar to plating in that it is a serial task with a bottle neck 
  at the oven, Each batch of parts takes about 25-30 minutes to cure. I plan on 
  inter-leaving this work with the plating which also takes 25-30 minutes per 
  batch. Typical batches in the oven are 2-5 parts. Typical batches in the plating 
  tank are about the same, should go like clock work (so to speak).</font></strong></tt></p>
