<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just getting started 
with block sanding here, it is huge, huge, huge, labor! I had no idea when I started 
this how much work it would really take. It was over 100 hours to get the first 
pass of sanding done. This showed of hundreds of high and low spots. The black 
guide code is standard hardware store spray paint which I used to show of low 
spots. Just spray on over the High build primer and sand off. Any silver sand 
through is a High spot, and low spots show up black. The weapon of choice for 
this sanding is a 20&quot; flexible sanding board for big panels an 11 inch block 
for medium with a six inch block for details. I started off with 220 grit wet 
and dry sand paper.</font></strong></TT>

waiting for its turn, Although it looks good from a distance you wouldn't believe 
how many problems the long board found. </font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want the inside 
of the body to have a nice finish so decided to prime and sand out the inside 
of the body too. I won't spend anytime filling high and low spots but at least 
want a nice smooth finish. I will end up with two coats of high build primer over 
two coats of DP40. Then two coats of color and two coats of clear.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After getting 
the first guide code off, you can really see the problems. Most of the yellow 
the gray is two part polyester glaze putty made by Evercoat. Its a special bondo 
that is creamy and easy to sand, it's used to build up minor low spots. Before 
all the hights and lows are worked out I'll go through many bottles. Even though 
it is much easier to cut than regular plastic filler it still sands best with 
150 or 180 Grit vs 220. I opted to wet sand as the dust from sanding is a huge 
problem in a household environment. If possible save this work for summer months, 
it would really be no fun in the winter.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a good 
example of the a sanded door getting some low spots filled. You can see the darker 
gray areas along the bottom of the door which are high spots. I'll need to build 
these up with filler and block them out. In the back ground you can see the bottle 
of plastic filler I'm using and some sand paper etc. This step was kind of a waste 
of time I should have gone ahead and mounted the doors on the car before filling 
them I ended up with allot more filler and sanding before it was done.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="blocking3_5_crop.jpg" HEIGHT=408 WIDTH=618>
</CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The door is 
  on getting lined up on the car, I'm building up with filler to get a perfect 
  fit. Each door took about 25 hours. When its complete there should be no metal 
  showing through and everything should be sanded out so that the edges of the 
  door are perfectly aligned with the body. Make sure you think about the extra 
  paint build up on the edges and make the gaps a bigger than you want them when 
  finished. I will be adding 3 more coats of high build primer, then a possible 
  sealer coat depending on the color choice, then 4-5 coats of clear. This will 
  add up to allot of paint.</font></strong></TT> </p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things are getting 
close here. Need to fill and sand out a few of the high spots. For larger high 
spots I use a body hammer to ding them down and then fill over. Most of the highs 
visible in this picture are very minor and should be covered by the next 3 coats 
of High build. Its a bit of a gamble but I can touch them up if I have some sand 
through at the end.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can see from 
this shot how much build up was required to get a perfect edge. The filler is 
no more that 1/16&quot; thick but this took about 5 passes with plastic sanding 
in between to get right. Sanding with an 24 inch long board was the quickest way 
to find the highs, and the guide coat shows off the lows.</font></strong></TT>

  <IMG SRC="blocking3_7crop.jpg" HEIGHT=318 WIDTH=570>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now here is 
  a problem. The rear deck lids on these cars never fit correctly from the factory, 
  add to this the fact that this car was in a major rear end and it spells lots 
  of work. I'll need to build the roof up about 1/8&quot; to get the lid flush, 
  and then cut the lower drip sill and lower it about 1/4&quot; to get a perfect 
  fit. More on this later.</font></strong></TT> </p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even though 
  the trunk tub was new metal, it still had a number of high and low spots that 
  needed to be worked out. I created a few installing the tub, but most were production 
  flaws from the factory. If I had this to do over I would have inspected much 
  more closely before priming and hammered more dents out.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bonnet 
  after the first pass of block sanding and some filler was added. I spent a good 
  solid month getting all the high and low spots out. Here I'm about 80% done 
  with blocking the filler out and will shoot another coat of high build primer 
  and sand out again. Before I shoot color three cycles of prime and sand cycles 
  will be done. The final coat(s) will be done with the bonnet mounted to the 
  car.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many hours 
  of filling and sanding later the rear deck is getting close. I filled up my 
  shop trash can with Worn out sand paper at least 3 times between the first Primer 
  coat and the second. The first coat showed off all the problems. After the second 
  coat of primer I'll switch to 400 grit and then 600 on the finial sand.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here the bottom 
  is getting the same treatment. Notice how much filler was needed even on a new 
  panel. I can't see how anyone can properly restore a car for profit.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The roof gets 
  the same, This car was particularly bad as it had been in a serious accident. 
  The only good news about block sanding is that it gets easier as you go. The 
  first coat and filling is the bulk of the work. The second coat (not shown here) 
  went in about one third the time with 400 grit, and the final coat will be about 
  the same.</font></strong></TT>
