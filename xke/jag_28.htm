<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The buffing 
  alone only took about 30 hours after all the sanding was done, but the total 
  sanding and buffing process went well over 100 hours. It is very hard work I 
  will say!</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tools of the 
  trade, a Makita variable speed buffer with Meguiars foam buffing pad. I would 
  hate to think how long buffing out a car would take without it. The foam pad 
  mounts with hook and loop interface, making for quick changes. When buffing 
  the speed is critical, The faster cutting the compound the slower the speed 
  typically. I run my buffer between speed one and three for entire process, never 
  faster. As you speed up the buffer you have to really watch out for over heating 
  the paint. This can cause bubbles or lifting!</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I bought a 
  Meguiars buffing kit with compounds, glazes, polishes, foam pads, the kit came 
  with 5 levels of buffing pads, and 6 levels of buffing compounds, glaze, and 
  polishes. The bottles shown are more than enough to do an entire car. Each compound 
  is to be used with its matching foam pad in a stepped process.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are some 
  of the foam pads, the pads are rated in ppi (pours per inch) starting with a 
  yellow pad which is 50 ppi, and ending with white which is 90 ppi. I find most 
  of the buffing is done with the yellow pad, this is the pad which takes the 
  sanded car up to a reasonable shine. The yellow pad is the magic pad in my opinion, 
  it takes the dull 4000 grit sanded clear which is ugly looking to a nice shine 
  in seconds. Like Magic! After the yellow comes green, blue, black, and white! 
  The process of getting a 3 foot square area fully polished only takes about 
  30 minutes, but is really hard work. Handling a 20 pound buffer with allot of 
  torque and trying to jump around on its own, takes allot out of your arms and 
  shoulders after a 5-6 hour session.</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is my 
  first panel buffed out, looks ok, as I did the buffing I learned that the better 
  the shine gets the more it shows off any micro scratches which may be left from 
  sanding. I ended up doing several touch up passes with 2500 - 4000 grit paper 
  to get these out. Its easy to do but takes time and patience. </font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
    shot of the roof is interesting in that it shows the reflection of the paint 
    booth plastic, above, You can notice in the center front a reflection of two 
    florescent tubes, which look slightly foggy. One easy way to tell if you haven't 
    done a proper job of color sanding is if the reflection in the paint is foggy. 
    I had to go over this area with 2500- 4000 grit paper again and re-buff.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is an example 
of a panel which is just about there, Nice true and sharp reflection, the goal 
is to get the reflections as straight and true as possible, any distortions in 
the reflection means the paint isn't perfectly smooth and needs more sanding. 
When doing this kind of inspection I looked at the panel from several angles, 
the reflections when looking at the panel from a 5-10 degree angle are best for 
showing off the problems. Even after going over the car several times touch up 
sanding and buffing there were still plenty of minor imperfections. Its just hard 
to say good enough at this stage.</font></strong></tt>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even 
    the lower sills get the full sand and buff, Notice the area where the rear 
    wheel well starts, This is an example of how the reflection is distorted because 
    the surface isn't smooth. I went over this area some more with a 800 - 4000 
    grit to smooth it out.!</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The body is about 
done now, I had a few minor burn throughs which will need to be fixed but these 
were minor, just a bit more work for the air brush. I will put the doors and hatch 
back on the car to keep them out of harms way, and bag the whole car up for storage 
while I work on the mechanical bits of the car.</font></strong></tt>
