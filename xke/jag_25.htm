<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Building a 
  paint booth was fairly quick and easy after doing all the work getting to the 
  point to need to build a paint booth. I put about 10 hours total in the booth 
  and it should save me at least 20 hours in sanding dust out of the clear coat.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I looked around 
  on the net and found a couple of examples of home made paint booths. From these, 
  I came up with a plan. I went for 1 inch PVC pipe as a frame. PVC is dirt cheap 
  in 20 foot lengths. I spent about $50 for nine 20 foot sections and all the 
  fittings. I didn't even bother gluing the pipe together. After I'm done with 
  the booth I can take it apart and store it under the house for future use.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One inch PVC 
  is pretty flexible so I put some hooks up and tied the tubing up to prevent 
  sags, The hooks keep the booth from moving around. I plan on using 1 mil plastic 
  drop cloths for covering in most places. I found 10x20 foot sheets at my local 
  hardware store for about $1.50 each. The booth is about 19'x15'x8' So two sheets 
  on top, and one on each side will do the trick ($6.00). I am using some 6 mil 
  clear plastic construction plastic I had laying around for the front and back. 
  I will have a number of fans mounted in the front and rear of the booth to get 
  air flow, so want to make sure that these areas are more robust.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Almost done 
  with the frame now, Just need to add a center beam down the middle of the booth 
  to keep the plastic sheet from sagging. Installing the plastic sheeting on the 
  top is a little tricky; just takes some time and trial and error. I built the 
  booth so that I can close the garage doors, I need to be able to close the door 
  to prevent the wind from damaging the plastic and blowing dust into the booth 
  through the fans. Before building started, I took everything out of the area 
  and pressure washed the floor to get as much dirt and dust out as possible. 
  I'll mop the floor after the booth is done to get the remaining dust knocked 
  down. For mopping I'll use a fairly soapy solution and wet mop. the soap will 
  catch any dust on the floor and hopefully keep it locked down.</font></strong></tt></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Shot the rocker 
guard, for the second time, on the wheel wells and washed the entire car with 
a soapy water mix, as recommended by PPG. After washing the car I covered it with 
a sheet of plastic to keep any dust/oil/dirt off the cleaned surfaces. When the 
booth is complete I'll just need to remove the plastic and finial wipe with grease 
and wax remover.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the frame 
  was up, I used duct tape to hold up the plastic sheeting. The top is two 10 
  x 20 foot sheets of 1 mil. drop cloth plastic. I have a make shift fan support 
  system in the back. My local paint jobber had inexpensive intake dust filters 
  $5 each. Out output Foam arresters for $4.</font></strong></TT></p>

  <p align="left"><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    fans/filters and rear wall are in now. I found these box fans at my local 
    Target store for $11 each. I'm running positive pressure in the booth and 
    sucking all air in through the dust filters on the back of these fans. With 
    the three fans running full blast I get a pretty good breeze in the booth.

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the output 
I ran 3 more fans with foam paint arresters. the output fans were not as powerful 
as the intake fans so I had a good amount of positive pressure. I may change out 
one of the output fans and install another of these box fans. I find when painting 
clear coat the fans can't keep up sucking out the dust. Its not a huge problem 
but I do see some fog in the booth which I would rather not have.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I didn't have 
  a fresh air system, however had a fairly powerful compressor so I bought this 
  SAS pure air 2000 filter, and a paint hood (about $260) The filter connects 
  to the compressor and really does a great job of filtering air before it goes 
  into the hood. I run my hood with 3 psi of Air while spraying and have zero 
  smell of paint in the hood. The paint gun connects to the pipe on the bottom, 
  this is nice because I avoid having two pipes in the booth stirring up dust, 
  and helps prevent hose drag onto fresh paint. The system has worked well except 
  that the gun air hose was defective and had to be replaced.</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This SAS paint 
hood was about $60. It has disposable lenses covers and is quick and easy to get 
on and off. It is much better in my opinion than a mask. No straps to get out 
of whack. The hose comes off the back so it is out of the way of the paint.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since I was running 
positive pressure it wasn't important that I had a perfectly air tight booth. 
The door was just cardboard and duct tape with velcro to hold it closed. Some 
small cracks were around the edges but weren't enough to let paint out of the 
booth in quantity.</font></strong></TT>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I needed to 
  have access to the compressor controls and filters etc., so made a door in the 
  wall. I usually start the painting day off by cleaning out the water traps and 
  filters!</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here the exhaust 
  fans are lined up. I couldn't figure out a way to filter the center fan. Its 
  a small fan and I'll probably replace it with another filtered box fan soon.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
    few of the tools of the trade. I am using a Devilbiss Finishline II HVLP gun. 
    Has been good for me. I find it is a little tricky with the PPG 2055 clear 
    but I can manage it with fine tuning and technique. The spray bottle in the 
    middle is used to spray an anti static mix on the booth, floor, and suit. 
    Its 50/50 isopropyl alcohol and water. Plenty of paint filters and mixing 
    cups, my fresh air setup, and the paint. The gallon can in the foreground 
    is finial wipe grease and wax remover. even have a timer for making sure I 
    don't shoot before the flash times are done.</font></strong></tt></p>

      shot for this page, Here is the booth ready to go. I love those 1 mil plastic 
      drop cloths They save me countless hours and worry with stray paint dust. 
      Its time to mask up, clean up and get to the painting.</font></strong></tt></p>
