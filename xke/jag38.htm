<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Progress is 
  flying now, with the engine back in and all the small parts already rebuilt. 
  Most of the big problems are solved. The fun but frustrating part is having 
  many projects going in parallel, each is stop and go as I discover parts I need 
  or problems which aren't easy to solve.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I rebuilt 
    all the gauges myself, with the exception of the Speedo which needed a professional 
    to re calibrate to 3.07 rear. Fortunately the chrome and gauges weren't in 
    really bad shape on this car so I just buffed up the switches and repainted 
    the Trim rings on the gauges. I cleaned and polished the original plating 
    on the smaller switches and gauges and tested each before reinstalling. I 
    made new seals for the gauges out of two or three rubber o rings super glued 
    together and cut to fit. The gauge face plates just needed a good cleaning. 
    For this i used windex and grease and wax remover. on a clean paper towel.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the 
  most difficult parts to find for this year E-type is the hash pattern aluminum 
  interior parts, They aren't being reproduced, so you have to find good used 
  parts. Good clean originals are very rare. I bought 3 sets of dash panels from 
  Ebay and took the best of the 3. This panel was nearly perfect. there is only 
  one little mark on it. I have heard that Classic Jaguar may be gearing up for 
  a run of these but for now its not listed on their web site currently. </font></strong></tt></p>

  <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was also 
    lucky that my left and right dash panels were in good shape, I cleaned them 
    up with Armor all and installed a new glove box, now the look like new! Wiring 
    up the center dash was a bit of a project, but with three versions of schematics 
    and pictures from original cars, I figured it out. Now I only have a couple 
    of wires that I can't account for, I'll have to get the rest of the car wired 
    and start testing before it becomes clear why I have these extra wires. Once 
    I have a battery for the car I'm sure I'll find all kinds of mistakes. I opted 
    for a completely new wiring harness from British wiring. The old Lucas harness 
    was well beyond reasonable salvage. </font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I installed 
  new tumblers in both the doors and the dash, the originals worked but were loose 
  and full of dirt, not giving the feel of a new lock when the key goes in. The 
  only negative from this that I have a door key and an ignition key. I can probably 
  reset the tumbler, but For now I can live with two keys. </font></strong></tt></p>

    rebuild most of the gauges myself, but the speedo was more than I could handle, 
    so it went out to a professional! I'll send the steering wheel out as well 
    once I get into the interior installation. I am planning on keeping the interior 
    out until I've got most of the mechanical issues worked out. No reason to 
    dirty up the interior until all the kinks are out of the engine and drive 
    train.</font></strong></tt></p>

    lucky to have 90% of the originals, but will be short 3 or 4 of the larger 
    ones. Ebay has really gone nuts over these Cheney clamps recently. </font></strong></tt></p>

    cable crimping tool to hold the pipes while I tapped the fittings in. These 
    plastic lines are a real bear to work with. Any one who has ever worked with 
    this Fuel line knows how tough it is. Even 40 year old plastic fuel line is

  starter wire runs around the front of the front of the sub frame instead of 
  over the transmission behind the engine. I put this in wrong the first time

    cut the original brads loose to get the chrome housing off of the latch. After 
    plating it I put it back in and tried tack welding it. The weld just wouldn't 
    hold up to the stress of door slamming, so I ended up tapping a #10 32tpi 
    screw into the main shaft and putting a washer behind it to distribute the 
    force. It seems to be holding fine now.</font></strong></tt></p>

      place online that sells modern replacement batteries that look like original 
      63 era Lucas lead acid batteries but are modern sealed maintenance free 
      units inside. This should save allot of grief. I've had normal lead acid 
      vintage replacement batteries in the past and they always leak acid. Acid 
      just kills the paint.</font></strong></tt></p>

    <p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is 
      the fuel tank after much toil. I had a heck of a time with this. First I 
      sent the tank out to a local radiator shop where they dipped it and coated 
      the inside, like a typical radiator shop they just shot black rattle can 
      on the outside right over the rust and dirt. So. I had to strip the outside 
      and repaint. After this was resolved, I discovered that the tank was a very 
      tight fit in the trunk. When I replaced the tub and most of the rear sheet 
      metal. a couple years ago, I had no templates or measurements to set the 
      back of the tub. So I found that it was about one inch to near the rear 
      wheel well. The result is that the tank was almost impossible to get in. 
      I managed to get it in after two weekends of cursing, but it is not a mistake 
      I'll ever make again. Next time I'm going to take some measurements before 
      hand from a known straight car. After getting the tank in I had to grind 
      out the mounting holes to get the bolts to line up. Lots of dirt and small 
      paint chips happened in this process in the tank area. I touched it up and 
      it isn't seen once the tank is in.</font></strong></tt></p>

      that I had to pull the starter because it was dead shorted. I had put a 
      little plastic bushing in upside down and it was letting the power pin to 
      touch ground. Many will say its impossible to pull a starter on a 3.8 E-type 
      without pulling the engine. This is untrue. You need some special tools 
      but I got it out in a couple hours with an &quot;S&quot; wrench and a modified
