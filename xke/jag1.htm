<TT><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> I've always had 
a weakness for British cars, don't know why exactly, but when my better half mentioned that co-worker was selling an old Jaguar, I was interested! Although  I was just finishing a four year restoration of a 59 Cadillac, and didn't really want or need a new project. However once you have the old car disease it's hard to say no to another clunker.</strong></font></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a few emails, I found out the Jaguar in question was a 1963 Jaguar E-Type. At the time I wasn't at all aware of the value and significance of this, but a quick google search made me quickly aware it was a great find. It was an early Series one!  Generally considered to be the purest form of the E-Type. The car was mostly complete but had rust in the usual places and was as worn down as you'd expect a 40 year old sports car to be after 146K miles of spirited driving. The Previous owner had replaced the head with a later 4.2 Liter head from an XJ6. Otherwise it was a numbers matching car. No major parts lost or missing. The interior had been replaced  and rust in the floors, doors and trunk floor. It is an original black plate California car with the (J/63) tag as applied by the state as was 
customary on CA Jaguars of this period. My wife and I just fell in love with it, and knew it was a special car and quite restorable which would be a ball to drive.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The previous owner maintained the car as well as possible since purchasing it in 1984. Most of this time it had been in storage, and was kept running. The Previous owner recalled that he bought it from a kid in Mountain View CA who's name has long since been forgotten. The trail before this is cold. We learned from the Jaguar Historical society that it was originally purchased on Jan 16th 1963 in San Francisco California by a B. Picasso. The original owner and period for the car we found interesting.  Eventually we intend to do some research to determine if this person was of any relationship to P Picasso. San Francisco of the early 60s was a beat nick 
and artist haven and it's possible that this could be a person of interest.  If anyone has any knowledge of a B. Picasso in San Francisco in the early 60s please contact me.</font></B></TT>

<TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Engine ran relatively well after some tuning and replacement of the fuel pump, however it had incorrect valve shims so the top end chattered loudly. I spent several weeks trying to get the timing and SU carbs to work consistently. In the end I couldn't get the engine adjusted to run nicely without major overhaul of the valve train and fuel delivery system. I realized eventually that nothing short of a total restoration would be appropriate.</font></B></TT>

<TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Doesn't look bad from 10 feet away, but up close it has all the signs of wear and age that a 40 year old car would. It survived at least one major accident and was loaded up with bondo. Rust is a problem, but not nearly as bad as many of the northern and eastern cars I've seen. The rust wasn't a structural issue.</font></B></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jaghome5.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320> </CENTER>
<TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Chrome needs plating, and the motor and suspension are well beyond acceptable wear. Still even in its worn state it was a blast to drive. Plenty of power left in the 3.8 Liter XK engine. The transmission rear seal leaks oil and so spirited driving was limited because oil from the seal would drip on the hot exhaust clouding up the interior.</font></B></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jaghome29.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original interior had been replaced with low end seat covers and the carpet was beyond trashed. The rubber on all the doors and windows was shot and water had entered the cockpit and started to do its magic on the foot wells and and the trunk tub. Fortunately the main floors and sills are solid. Rust in other places wasn't a big problem. After stripping the paint I discovered a massive amount of body damage but that's a later story.</font></B></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jaghome26.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What great lines on these cars! The front driver's side fender was replaced some where along the way and bondo was loaded in many places on the drivers side just behind the hood. All of this will be cut out and replaced.</font></B></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC=jaghome8.JPG HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><B><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It appears even from a distance that something is wrong with the rear end. The bumpers were damaged, and the backup light is missing, closer inspection found that about two inches of bondo had been generously loaded into the rear to hide damage caused by a rear ender. This and the associated rust will require the replacement of the trunk tub, license plate frame, and the hatch deck. This will be my first attempt at major body work, and should be more than enough of a challenge.</font></B></TT>
