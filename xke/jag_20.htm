<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After using 
  the <a href="http://www.caswellplating.com">Caswell</a> copy cad zinc kit a 
  few months, I ordered a similar size nickel kit. As I became more experienced 
  with plating with Zinc and Nickel my process evolved into a small plating production 
  line. I have both the Nickel and Zinc tanks set up in this shot with the crock 
  pot on the end heating SP de greaser. The de greaser is a mix of soap and some 
  mild ammonia which is used to naturalize acids and plating solutions left on 
  parts after they come out of the various tanks. Lets go through the process.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The subject, 
  a brake servo linkage. Some parts are black oxide, others were silver cad. I 
  start by bead blasting everything and then buff out the parts which will be 
  silver with a wire wheel. Parts which are to be black oxide are zinc plated, 
  parts which were originally cadmium will be Nickel. Yellow cadmium parts are 
  also zinc plated.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <img SRC="typicalbatch1_crop.jpg" HEIGHT=326 WIDTH=603> 
</center>
<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I usually do about 
6-10 bags of parts at a time. Each bag of parts is emptied into a dish and the 
contents referenced in a spreadsheet I use to track all parts. I make note of 
original finish, replacement finish and missing parts. After documenting the original 
finish I bead blast all parts to remove dirt, rust and old plating. In this picture 
you can see several parts have been blasted, others are plated, and some are in 
progress. </font></strong></tt>

  <img SRC="blastbar1_crop.jpg" HEIGHT=298 WIDTH=512> 
</center>
<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I find a magnetic 
bar is perfect hold small parts for blasting. It is easier to see the part on 
the bar than in a bead blasting basket. It is possible however to blow parts off 
the bar if they are small, so be careful if you try this. I have had to remove 
and sift the media several times to find lost parts. I've tried a wire basket 
several times, but find that most of the time parts are difficult to inspect in 
the cab and require repeat trips for touch up. The part in the picture is a good 
example of some of a part which will be zinc plated and then coated with black 
oxide or yellow chromate. The bracket is yellow cad, and the bolt and nut are 
black oxide.</font></strong></tt>

</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the parts 
  are bead blasted clean of any old plate or rust etc. I inspect and look for 
  damage and make the call on what to replace. In this picture for example I'll 
  scrap the wiper fluid nozzles as they were chrome plated aluminum and will be 
  difficult to re plate. The screws and nuts will be re plated in Nickel, and 
  the lock washers will be replaced. I tend to trash all lock washers as they 
  are still available. I update the spreadsheet to say what is to be replaced.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are some 
  of the common sizes of washers. I have found that <http://www.mcmaster.com/> MC 
  Master Carr has just about everything you could possibly need in terms of fasteners. 
  The prices are much better than local hardware stores, and the web site is fantastic. 
  I can order parts on a Sunday and have them in my hands by Wednesday of the 
  same week in most cases.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Depending on the 
desired level of shine desired on plated parts I buff or wire wheel the parts 
after bead blasting. Most of the hardware is black oxide coated, and buffing isn't 
required, however any of the parts which are to be silver or golden cad or Nickel 
get some wire wheel prep before plating.</font></strong></tt>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
    the parts are bead blasted and buffed as needed, they are wired with copper 
    and hung in the acid pickle for 10-15 minutes. This is the tank on the right 
    of this picture. The <a href="http://www.caswellplating.com">Caswell</a> Nickel. 
    kit came with this neat heater which I use to warm the acid pickle up to around 
    180 degrees. After pickling the parts they go for a short dip in the SP de 
    greaser to kill the acid, and then into a bucket of clean water until they 
    are plated. The water bath is mainly to slow down flash rust while parts are 
    waiting to go into the plating tanks.</font></strong></tt></p>

</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parts wait 
  for plating here for up to an hour, I find if the parts stay in the water tank 
  more than about an hour they need to go back into the acid to kill flash rust. 
  Flash rust on parts contributes to brownish finish on zinc parts, and poor plating 
  adhesion on nickel parts.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the <a href="http://www.caswellplating.com">Caswell</a> 
Zinc plating tank is all ready to go. I have 4 anodes in the tank, a heater and 
an Air agitator. I connect the negative lead to the tank bar hang the parts across 
the bar to complete the circuit. The air hose creates bubbles which help keep 
the solution stirred up and prevents bubbles from forming on the surface being 
plated. </font></strong></tt>

  <img src="platingsolution1_crop.jpg" height=381 width=391> 
</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After Zinc 
  plating parts there are several chromate's which can be used to tint the surface. 
  The blue bottle is a black chromate concentrate, just dip the part in the concentrate 
  for about 30 seconds and allow to dry, or make a solution with water for longer 
  soaking. The chrome stick is a magnet which I use to lift parts in and out of 
  the solutions. For larger parts, you can swab on the blackener with a napkin 
  or make up a solution in a bigger tank with water. The gold solution is a mix 
  of a yellow chromate concentrate and water, used to create a simulated yellow 
  or golden cadmium finish. Dip the parts directly into the bottle on the plating 
  wire just after being removed from the plating tank, allow the part to soak 
  from 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on desired darkness of yellow. Before 
  dipping into the solution in should be heated to about 90 degrees. Both the 
  black and the yellow chromate harden the zinc improve the durability of the 
  finish. After parts are dipped. and left to dry, I dip the parts into a polyurethane 
  sealer (silver can) and allow to dry. For the black oxide I skip the sealer 
  and shoot them with WD40. without oil or sealer the black parts can form a white 
  oxide. Black oxide parts typically have a thin film of oil on them at all times.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I bought this 
power supply from a local electronics store for about $200. It does up to 18 volts 
at 5 Amps. I find most zinc parts plate best between 1.3 and 2 volts and around 
1 - 2 amps. I look at the part and make sure bubbles are forming in a slow but 
even pattern. For larger parts I increase the voltage and amperage and connect 
2 or more wires to the part to help even out the electrical field. On nickel parts 
I use a bit higher voltage and amperage ad the nickel is a harder metal, and bubbles 
don't form as easily on the surface. Plating time s for zinc parts are in the 
3-15 minute range while Nickel parts are 15-40 minutes on average.</font></strong></tt>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the <a href="http://www.caswellplating.com">Caswell</a> 
nickel kit ready to go, It takes about 2-3 hours to heat it up to proper plating 
temp. (80-90 degrees). When plating I start off by turning up the tank heaters 
first thing in the morning before breakfast. After breakfast and some chores they 
are ready to go. Each anode has a cloth bandage designed to keep residue from 
falling into the plating tank and contaminating the solution. In this shot I have 
the plates in way below the top of the bandage. I fixed this after taking this 
picture.</font></strong></tt>

  buffing the part and the finish looks very similar to silver cad or zinc, but 
  is harder and won't corrode.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This parts came 
out well except for some hazy area in the low part above the bushing hole. I can 
live with it, but it could be avoidable by attaching more wires and running higher 
current while the part was plating.</font></strong></tt>
