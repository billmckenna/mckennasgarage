<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This part part 
of the process is around 80 hours work. This includes building a trolley and cutting 
all the rusted areas out of the body. It also includes stripping allot of the 
paint, and undercoating. I did this over a about a month in June 2002.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After every nut 
bolt and screw was removed from the shell, I needed to be able to move the shell 
so built a trolley. What I found is that the balance of the trolly wasn't good 
the center of gravity is pretty far back on the shell and so the trolly wasn't 
a good idea. Next time I'd drop this step all together and go straight to the 
rotisserie. I'll cut this trolley up for parts and after the bottom is painted 
I'll build a new trolley which bolts to the car on the rear suspension and sub 
frame mount points. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="xkestrip2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even though this 
trolley wasn't great it worked well enough to move the shell out of the garage 
and start stripping the paint. This I discovered was a huge project, and a big 
waste of time. After going through many sanding disk. I took the whole thing out 
for Sand blasting. I focused instead on finding the bulk of the body damage and 
rusted areas and I cut out any sections which would need to be replaced before 
sending out to the blaster. There is no reason to pay the blaster to blast metal 
that will be replaced later, and the more access the blaster has to the inner 
body the better. Next time I do a car restoration I'll go even further in the 
stipping out of metal before sending out. I should have cut the trunk tub out 
and possibly all of the floors and both cowls etc.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="xkestrip5.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rear end had 
been crushed in a serious way. Previous body work left and dozens of holes used 
to pull out dents. All of this was covered by over an inch of bondo. I had no 
idea when I first saw the car that this damage was even there. This is typical 
though with cars which are 40 plus years old. Seems like every person doing restoration 
I talk to has a similar tale.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trunk tub 
  is a rusty mess. I'm glad these are being reproduced. I'd hate to have to fix 
  all of this rust. The area all along the wheel wells is paper thin, and rust 
  pin holes are all across the bottom. Paint still covers most of the problems 
  in this picture.</font></strong></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="drvsidbehindoor1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hard to believe 
all the things bondo can hide. This is the rear quarter panel on the driver's 
side behind the door. Its been drilled and pulled but has a big crease right in 
the middle of the panel. Fortunately I can get to the panel from behind and will 
be able to hammer and dolly out allot of this. Some shrinking of the crease will 
also be required, and a good bit of lead.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="drvsidelpdam1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you thought 
the last bit was bad, this is a close up of the boot and license plate area. Hard 
to believe that some bodger could leave this like this and just bondo over it 
all. I'll be spending many hours correcting this. Replacing all the rear sheet 
metal will be the only real solution. The other side of the trunk is just as bad.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="passidelpdam1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What a mess, it 
was quite a crunch. I'll need the upper deck, license plate frame, Trunk tub inside 
supports and joining plates, and new tail light surrounds.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="pasoutersil2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unlike many of 
these cars the sills weren't majorly rusted! Damage was another story. Both sides 
had been bent up in accident(s). Previous repairers did a wonderful job of drilling 
and pulling out the dents. I'll cut this section out before sending the car to 
the blaster. This is on the passenger side under the door.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><img src="badpan4.JPG" height=240 width=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is what was 
left of the cowl on the driver's side. Bondo hid the problems, This is an easy 
part to replace, but will require blending in with lead once welded into place.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="badpan3.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Same panel from 
the other side. Rust hand been working through the bottom. In addition to the 
damage on the top. Yet another part on my sheet metal order list.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="drvsdcowl2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The upper cowl 
suffered some damage too. This will be easy to fix, but points to overall body 
twisting cause by a serious wreck.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER>
  <img src="drvsdrearfend1.JPG" height=240 width=320> 
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rear of the 
car on the driver's side also had some hidden damage. Nothing hard to fix, but 
all the problems add up to allot of time. What else is new. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorskinrust1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both door skins 
had rusted through. The drain plugs clog very easily trapping water. Both will 
be stripped and re skinned.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="drmispan1.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Only light surface 
rust on the inside of the panel, except for the bottom where the cowl meets the 
sill. The lower cowl rusted through along the seam. This is one of the areas which 
collects road dirt on all E-types. When I cut the panel out I found about 2 inches 
of dirt in the botom of this panel. Not sure how it gets in but dirt absorbs water 
in places like this and rust is the result.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="drrusthole1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Behind the door 
is another one of the dirt collector areas. I cut out the rusted area before sending 
the shell out for blasting and more dirt and rust. I made sure to tell the blaster 
to get all the rust out. In this area the rear had rusted through into the wheel 
well, this allowed more water and dirt to get forced in.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="pasrusthole2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It appeared that 
one reason this rusted so much is that there was never any metal stopping water 
from the rear wheel well from getting into this panel. A large area was open from 
the factory. This is visible on the center left of the picture. When the car is 
driven in the rain water is forced into this hole and into the body. When I cut 
out these panels. Both were full of 6 inches of dirt and muck from the road. This 
dirt held water and contributed to the rust.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="passbehnddoor1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This is what 
the problem started off looking like, both sides were about the same. The front 
cowls showed less rust through but wer about the same. The lead helps cover some 
of the damage.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="pasrusthole3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A little blurry, 
  but this is the kind of minor rust through on the inner panel. I'll end up patching 
  in a 3 inch plate into the panel where these holes are. This was a good place 
  to practice welding too. It never will be seen once its done. </font></strong></TT>
