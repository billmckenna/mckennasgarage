<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the first 
  3 coats of clear were good and dry, I sanded down the car with 800 grit wet 
  sanding, and repaired any runs or sags. I used a Hutches finishing dual action 
  sander for the large panels and a six inch hard foam sanding block for the tight 
  spots. The DA sander makes quick work of the orange peel, but if you've missed 
  any high spots during the block sanding, the DA will find them and will burn 
  through in no time flat. I found about 10 spots which had to be repaired after 
  using the DA sander. One lesson learned is, don't get any where near the edges 
  with 800 grit on a DA! This picture shows the car after all the sanding was 
  done and I had masked up to do the touch up work and shoot 3 more coats of clear.

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a typical 
  example of burn through from the DA because there was a high spot below in the 
  primer. This case shows why it is so important to block the car down several 
  times with a good guide coat and to inspect it inch by inch before shooting 
  color. Its just plain old poor prep work, my long boards missed these high spots. 
  Its easy to do regardless of how many primer coats are shot. </font></strong></TT></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was the 
  worst of the burn throughs, right down to bare metal. I probably dropped a tool 
  or here and made some dings. The solution to these problems was an air brush 
  to blend in fresh base and clear. First I used a small amount of Evercoat finishing 
  glaze to cover the bare steel producing a reliable bonding surface, Then I used 
  an airbrush to shoot two coats of color, expanding and feathering the edges 
  on the second coat. I found that the air brush was the cleanest way to make 
  these small repairs because the paint is very finely atomized and blends at 
  the edge with a fine mist. I slightly over reduce the base or clear when using 
  the air brush because the tip is very fine. </font></strong></tt></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a typical 
sand through on the bonnet. After shooting the base I experimented with DBC 500 
blending reducer, this is a clear DBC which you mix 50/50 with reduced color and 
shoot over your base coat to blend the edges. I tested this on a couple of areas 
and it works very well, but I found that since I was using an airbrush I didn't 
really need to do extra blending. On a large area repair I think it would have 
been more important. In my case after the base coat had flashed I shot over reduced 
2055 clear over the repair area with a touch up gun or air brush. The 2055 clear 
uses the same reducer as the base coat and melts the edges of the base coat repair 
as it sets up. The results were in detectable! I have to say that this experience 
helped me understand why base and clear is replacing single stage paints. Nicer 
shine, easier to work with, very forgiving to repair!</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This shot is 
  of the nasty bare metal burn through from above after blowing in base with an 
  air brush and four coats of clear. I a two coat patch about 10 inches in diameter 
  of clear over the repair area then after I was done with all the repairs, I 
  cleaned up everything and shot three more coats of clear for build and depth. 
  For a total of 6 coats of clear on the entire car. This is about 1.7 gallons 
  of 2055 clear un reduced. About 2.5 gallons of actual clear coat on the car.

  <p align="left"><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most 
    paint jobs are only three to four coats of clear, however for a show finish 
    its important to load on more clear. The three extra coats help produce a 
    much deeper shine and the six coats of clear are so thick that you have to 
    work pretty hard to burn through, even with the DA sander and 800 grit. The 
    sanding process I used was 800 grit on the DA and block, 1500 grit on DA and 
    block, 2000 grit foam pad on the DA sander, 2500 grit by hand with a block, 
    3000 grit on a block, and 4000 grit foam pad on the DA sander, Then buffing. 
    That is allot of sanding but I took it in three foot square sections and got 
    all the micro scratches out before polishing. Before shooting the last three 
    coats of clear I did an abbreviated sanding process, 800 grit on DA and block, 
    1500 grit on DA and block, 2000 grit foam pad on DA and 4000 grit foam pad 
    on the DA. I found that the more gloss you can get on the clear before buffing 
    the easier it is to spot ripples, scratches and orange peel. I had a bunch 
    of runs in the first three coats of clear and needed to get them all perfectly 
    flat, sanding to 4000 grit gives a pretty nice shine and shows off any missed 
    areas.</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> One of the reasons 
I sanded down the car to such a fine grit before shooting the last three coats 
of clear was to improve the paint flow. The smoother the finish the better the 
clear coat flows out. I didn't have a high end clear coat gun so having the extra 
fine shine helped keep the orange peel down. The down side is that it also helps 
the runs and sags. I moved the gun more quickly on the last three coats of clear 
to put a thinner build per coat, and only have a few runs when complete.</font></strong></TT>

  <p align="left"><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
    six coats of clear the bonnet is looking good even before block sanding, Sanding 
    takes time even with the DA but after sanding and buffing it should be like 
    glass!</font></strong></TT></p>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here I am in progress 
cutting down the clear with 800 grit, This part of the bonnet took about two hours 
to get smooth. Wet sanding is messy work, sanding slurry goes everywhere.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is my wet 
sanding bucket. I've used this bucket since the beginning and its showing it now, 
you can see a selection of sanding blocks. I have three or four 6 inch blocks 
each with different hardness. The harder blocks are best for taking out orange 
peel but as you work around highly curved areas the softer blocks are preferable. 
I also keep my sanding disks for the DA in the same bucket and have a rag to mop 
up sludge.</font></strong></TT>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here the cowl 
  is pretty much sanded with 800 grit. The 800 grit cuts quickly but leaves large 
  scratches which need to be sanded out with 1500 and 2000 grit. Above 2000 grit 
  the scratches aren't really visible. Sanding with fine grit paper is done more 
  by feel than sight. You can feel when the paper is cutting and assume that when 
  it stops cutting you have gotten the area smooth.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Here is the 
  best tool I've bought in a long time, the Hutchens 3500 Finishing DA sander, 
  behind it you can see a pile of micro fiber towels. These are a must have for 
  finishing work, they are very soft and pick up dust better than any rag I've 
  ever seen. I got a whole pack of 20 from Costco for $9, worth every penny! When 
  they get dirty just throw them in the wash and they clean up good as new!</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finishing Sand 
  paper and Razor blades! I went through an unknown quantity of both. Razor blades 
  are a must for cutting down runs and fine finishing work. There are dozens of 
  little fixes you do with razor blades; cutting down dust nibs, cutting down 
  runs, small touch ups with filler or paint, cutting tape and masking paper. 
  I tried several makes and brands of sand paper, including mquires and 3M. I 
  found that the 3M Imperial paper shown above is the best over all. I liked the 
  mquires too, but found the Imperial paper lasted longer.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the 
  bonnet sanded out with 4000 grit and ready to be re-coated with clear, I'm just 
  starting to mask up, and doing the finial inspection. Inspection of paint between 
  coats is one of the most important parts of the job. You would be surprised 
  what you will notice if you look closely at paint, but worth finding and fixing 
  before you get further along.</font></strong></tt></p>
