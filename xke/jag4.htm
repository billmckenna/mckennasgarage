<CENTER><HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This part of the tear down is more than half way through the process, 
I'd estimate that less than 100 hours of work are left to do here.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the Engine 
was stored away and out of the picture tear down progressed rapidly, I took many 
pictures of the suspension and front end as reference. Removing all the brake 
lines, steering, wiring etc. was a quick process but it is always good to take 
it slow and document everything.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="vacures1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much E-type mail 
list discussion has been had over this vacuum reservoir and its original lettering. 
Mine has most of this visible, and I'll make a patter of this before stripping 
the paint. The original blue isn't looking to bad on parts of the sub frame. Fortunately 
I won't need to match the paint from this car. I'm not even sure what color we 
will go for in the end.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="subframe1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This turned out 
to be a nice shot of the engineless front end. All the steering and suspension 
is still in, and looking pretty tired. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fwall1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dozens of small 
parts like these covers will need to be tracked and stored. The original color 
reproduced etc. The national Jaguar club keeps a listing of all the correct colors 
for just about all the parts on E-types in the various periods and models.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER>
  <font size="+1"><IMG SRC="shell3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></font>
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Strip down is 
almost done now. Just a few more parts to go. The natural weight distribution 
of the FHC body on jack stands is a little awkward. If you are doing this type 
of thing it is easy for the car to tip back on the stands since the center of 
gravity is very far back without the front end on. Put a bunch of heavy items 
like air tools in the foot wells to make sure it doesn't surprise you and fall 
off the stands. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fwall2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The body shell 
is very light once stripped. I could lift either end with little effort. I'd guess 
the entire shell is around 300 pounds. It will be even lighter once I get all 
the rust, paint, and lead off of it. Some of the sub frame hardware was pretty 
rusty. Water got into the foot well area and the lower sub frame bolts didn't 
fair very well. Fortunately the rust wasn't bad enough to be a structural issue. 
Many people have told me how lucky this car was from a rust stand pont. Don't 
think I could have handled a full floor and sill replacement.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="strippedint2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here you can see 
the rusted area in the front of the floor pan. Its only surface rust on the kick 
panel, but the foot well pans are beyond saving. The lighter brown isn't rust, 
but rather dirt and old insulation from the original interior. The foot wells 
are the lowest areas on the car and so were not only rusted, but also dented up 
badly. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="strippedint1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another shot of 
the interior of the shell. I won't bother trying to clean this up. except for 
getting all the under coating off. The sand blaster will do the rest. That's another 
part of the restoration. Right now I'm just getting the last hardware out and 
inspecting the mess.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="subframe3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two tired old sub 
frames. I had hoped these would be reusable, and rust wasn't an issue, however 
the driver's side frame was bent in an accident, so both will go. I haven't decided 
yet which brand of sub frame to buy. Martin Robey makes exact replicas, but Classic 
Jaguar has a set which is reportedly stronger and overall better constructed. 
</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rearebd5.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dropping the rear 
end was simple enough. Getting all the bolts off was a little challenging, but 
nothing a little patience didn't overcome. The rear end is quite heavy so don't 
try to lift it without help. I used a dolly and floor jack to move it around before 
I tore it down. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rearend10.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's a picture 
from the beginning of break down the rear end. The dishes in the foreground are 
for temporary parts storage. I usually fill up 5-6 with parts and then bag them 
up and enter a detailed description for each numbered bag in a spreadsheet. I 
note any damaged, missing parts so I can at a glance tell what needs to be replace 
before sifting through each bag.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rearend_out1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just another rear 
end removal picture, notice the fuel line on the floor. The strip down is pretty 
much done now, just a few odds and ends to clean up.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rearend4.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What the heck, 
one more picture of the rear end. More dust and road dirt that anyone would care 
to see, but not for long.</font></strong></TT>
