<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rebuilding 
  sub systems is a long process, I started this with powder coating around Aug. 
  2004, and I'm a bit over half way done at present. (Nov 2004). I have at least 
  300 hours in this so far. There are just to many parts I've rebuilt to document 
  clearly on the web. I'll just give an overview of the process and point out 
  a few tips here.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are two 
  of your best friends when rebuilding things A good caliper and the shop manual. 
  I typically start by reading as much as I can in the shop manual, identify parts 
  that are to be replaced, verses reused, and shop around the &quot;usual&quot; 
  suppliers before ordering. I tend to use Terry's Jaguar parts and XK's Unlimited 
  for most things however I also like Classic Jaguar. Ebay is also a great source 
  for parts if you know exactly what you are looking for, and don't mind battling 
  it out in an auction.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I used a numbered 
  bag system of tracking parts, about 400 total bags of parts, At the point I 
  started rebuilding things I separated parts into areas, Brakes, Engine, Front 
  suspension, Rear suspension, Interior, Chrome etc. I then further grouped the 
  bags into projects and made sure all the parts were accounted for before starting. 
  I tended to order parts in batches which aligned roughly with 2-3 projects. 
  Heater parts and Front suspension for example.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a good 
  example of a typical rebuild project. All parts in this case were bead blasted 
  with exception of the bearings! I use worn out glass bead in my cab at about 
  80 PSI to avoid damage or excess wear to the parts. I tested parts like the 
  vacuum advance to insure that it was reliable. After blasting I wire wheel the 
  parts to get them back to a factory appearance. The basic clean and update part 
  of Distributor rebuild is fairly simple however setting up and testing after 
  the unit is complete is beyond a normal shop. Fortunately for me I had a great 
  resource just a few miles away.</font></strong></tt>

    Dick Vandermeyden of San Carlos CA has a period Sun distributor machine and 
    years of experience working on Jaguar distributor. With this machine you can 
    check the dwell and spark advance, both mechanical and vacuum at any RPM from 
    100-10K. Dick is one of the rare few who not only has the knowledge but also 
    loves to pass it on and has seen just about everything once. When we checked 
    out the unit above we found that the top half of the breaker plate was rocking 
    like crazy on the lower half when the distributor was turning. You'd never 
    see this if you didn't run the unit with the cap off but this caused the dwell 
    to change as much as 5 degrees on every revolution. What we found upon investigation, 
    is that there are three little plastic buttons on the bottom of the top half 
    of the breaker plate which keep the unit riding correctly. Two of the three 
    parts were worn out so Dick custom machined perfect copies of the remaining 
    button. Once installed the distributor was nearly perfect, both on Spring 
    and vacuum advance. I of course would never had been able to do this on my 
    own. You need quite a bit of experience and specialized tools or you'll spend 
    allot of money and time and still have problems. </font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each new project 
  has its own challenges, in the case of the starter, it was working when the 
  car was torn down, but, I wanted to clean up everything and make sure it was 
  in top shape. Before reinstalling. Its nearly impossible to get a starter out 
  of a 3.8 Liter E-type without pulling the engine so its important to spend the 
  extra time up front. On close inspection I found that this starter was actually 
  a later lucas starter from 67 which is physically the same but has different 
  number, so I will troll ebay to find a correct starter and rebuild this unit 
  as a backup. I was able to find an original Lucas rebuild kit for the starter 
  NOS, and will use the kit to rebuild a correct 1963 core. I replaced the brushes 
  in the original and repainted it. Otherwise it was all fine. </font></strong></tt></p>

    The Air cleaner plenum was just dirty and had been repainted several times. 
    I stripped bead blasted it back to the base fiberglass and glazed it with 
    polyester body putty, Sanded it down and shot it with the correct silver hammer 
    tone paint. Eastwood sells a pretty good match for the original silver paint 
    that came on most of the under hood parts on this period XKE.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some parts 
  like the brake calipers and masters were beyond the ability of my shop. stripped 
  and bead blasted them then sent them out to a professional for re-sleeve. I 
  used Sierra Specialties in Southern CA. Before having the sleeving done I had 
  the calipers nickel plated, by Van Nuys plating. They came back looking better 
  than new. The Masters were powder coated in a steel poly powder from Eastwood. 
  Sierra Specialties includes their own sealing rings for the master cylinder 
  pistons which are closer to the original Girling parts than what comes in the 
  modern kits. From what I understand the modern repro kits have a harder rubber 
  in the oil seal which has a tendency to wear out quicker and leak.</font></strong></tt></p>

  about $50 to get prepped and coated.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I went to some 
lengths to find original Metalastik rubber bushings for this project, and found 
that they are almost completely gone. Metalastik isn't making automotive rubber 
parts anymore and all that is left is NOS. I did get the correct parts for these 
swing arms, but had no luck on upper A-arm bushings or IRS mounts.</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parts storage 
  is an issue for me, I have very limited space in the garage so I have to use 
  every inch, and plan stages of the restoration around the space limitations. 
  My plan is to do all the powder coating and small part rebuilds before I start 
  putting the car back together. This is important for 3 reasons. First, powder 
  coating, bead blasting and painting are messy and would surely lead to dirt 
  and shop rash on the body of the car if it were uncovered. Second, with the 
  powder coating cab out in the garage there is no room to put on the sub frame. 
  Third, when I remove the trolley from the body of the car to install the sub 
  frame, I'll also need to find a home for all the boxes of parts. I won't even 
  start to put the car back together until the IRS is fully rebuilt, all the front 
  suspension and brake parts are ready to go on and all the other sub units are 
  ready to bolt up. This will limit shop rash, I'll also get the Engine torn down 
  before hand and send it out for rebuild while I'm putting the car back together, 
  when the engine comes back I hope to be ready to drop in the car. Project management 
  is key in some phases of car restoration, during other phases its not as important 
  but for sure paint and final assembly are dangerous periods where the shop needs 
  to be very controlled and clean.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting all 
  of the smaller parts of the suspension rebuilt and ready to bolt was several 
  months of work. Here is a front hub assembly ready to go on the car. I installed 
  new ball joints and spindles on the carriers which were nickel plated! I saved 
  most of the original hardware and nickel plated this myself. Setting the right 
  play in the ball joints took some trial and error but the shop manual is very 
  good in describing how the parts should be set up.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The upper A-arms 
  ball joint kits went in very nicely no problem getting these installed in an 
  evening.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The spreadsheet 
  I made up originally to track bags of parts has evolved and now has sections 
  to filter parts by group, brakes, Engine, Body, Interior etc. I added comments 
  along the way to the sheet and it is coming in very handy now when putting things 
  back together. Next time I do this I'll make sure I put more of the similar 
  parts in single bags, so instead of having Left side part blah and right side 
  part blah they are all in one bag with comments to indicate anything unusual. 
  Live and learn. Still I don't know how people used to restore cars before having 
  Laptops and digital cameras!</font></strong></tt></p>
