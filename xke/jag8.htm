<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hard to calculate 
the time for body work, however I'd estimate that about 100 hours of work went 
into the door skinning and patching the sills etc. This was done over June July 
and Aug 2002.</font></strong></TT>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rear fenders 
were rippled pretty badly, I have no idea how the fenders got this way, but it 
was clear that a previous repairer had done quite a bit of hammering on these 
before covering the entire mess with bondo. I'll be leading these later in the 
body work process.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="welder1.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mig welding is 
the way to go for this kind of project. I chose the lincoln SP-135 Plus. It would 
have been impossible to do most of this work without it. It has variable tap power 
so it can be adjusted to the voltage level avoiding burn through. I find that 
for 20 gauge steel just below D and 5-6 on the wire speed is the perfect setting. 
For thicker sheet metal like roof rails etc. I use the E setting and 7 on wire 
speed. I've done 1/8&quot; thick work before with it set to G or H. I use it with 
argon shield gas, and .023&quot; wire. Interesting to note. The argon goes pretty 
quickly I use about three 150 pound tanks for every 3 pound spool of wire at 20-25 
cfm.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sillhole6.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before sandblasting 
  the damaged areas in the sills were cut out, giving access to the inner sills. 
  The blaster removed all of the rust and old paint and I repainted these areas 
  with POR 15 and then waxed over the paint before welding in patches. Previous 
  repairers drilled and pulled dents out in these areas, stretching the metal 
  beyond practical repair. It was nice having the sills open so a complete inspection 
  could be made of the inner sills and any rusted areas discovered. Fortunately 
  there was almost no rust on the inside of the sills.</font></strong></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sillhole4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The patches for 
the Sills will be cut out of 20 gauge steel and rolled into shape by hand. I cut 
a cardboard pattern for each hole, then scribed the outline on to the sheet metal 
stock. To get the right shape I used the sill as a template. Just lay the metal 
down on the sill and bend the curve until it matches. I annealed the sheet metal 
first so it would bend by hand with little hammering. To anneal, just use a torch 
to heat the steel up to around 1000 degrees. It takes a little practice, but you 
can tell when the steel is right as it bends freely without spring back.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sheetmetal3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I used standard 
  tin snips for most work, I have an air nibbler and electric cutting wheel, but 
  find them harder than the snips. I usually cut the panel a few mil larger than 
  I need and then grind it into perfect shape with an angle grinder. The goal 
  is to get the panel to fit with 1 millimeter gap. This is easily filled when 
  welding in the panel. Larger gaps can also be filled with the mig welder, but 
  these make weaker welds and require more grinding. Its not an exact science 
  but the better the fit the better the weld, and the better the final finish, 
  meaning less lead or plastic filler to cover the seams.</font></strong></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sillpatch12.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a panel 
freshly welded in. When welding sheet metal, always stitch weld. Weld small areas 
less than an inch in any one area at a time. Let the metal in one area cool while 
doing another part of the weld. I usually start by tack welding in the panel, 
then put more tack welds are two or three inches apart, then go around and fill 
each gap a little at a time. If you overhead the panel it will warp, especially 
on the body side, this makes more work filing and filling and overall a worse 
job. Use the discoloring as a heat guide. try to keep the discoloring as localized 
and small as possible. Turn the heat down on the mig welder to C if needed, especially 
if the surrounding metal is thin from grinding.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sillpatch2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the weld 
is done, wire wheel the area to clean the welds and to see how solid they are, 
often you'll find pin holes in the welds which need to be filled. after you fill 
the obvious holes grind down the welds and inspect again. Try not to grind the 
surrounding metal as it will become thin. I tend to use 36 grit flap disk on a 
four inch angle grinder for this. after I've got the grinds down to about the 
level you see on the left, I use a 60 grit wheel to finish up. Avoid burning the 
metal, or thinning out the panels. Often after you grind down the welds you find 
more areas which need to be touched up with the welder. make one or two more passes 
through this to get it looking good.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sillpatch9.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the patch 
after several welding and grinding passes, ready for lead work. Its hard to avoid 
some dishing of the area around the weld, so plastic or lead filler is used to 
bring up the low spots, Use a pick hammer to bring down any high spots. I'd estimate 
tat this patch took about four hours to get to this point. Slow work but very 
enjoyable. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="leaddrside1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the same 
patch after lead work. I usually save up all the lead work until I'm sure that 
I'm done welding. Lead melts at around 400F so welds anywhere near it will ruin 
any lead that's been put down. Its hard to get lead perfect, so use a high build 
primer or plastic filler to get the minor imperfections out.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="wheelwell1.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flash rust is a 
real problem on bare steel, even in a dry climate like California. I found that 
after a month or two,I started spending more of my type trying to keep rust from 
starting than working on the car. I decided to prep and paint areas of the car 
which were ready along the way. After knocking out all the dents and sanding down 
the metal in any given area I cut any remaining seam sealer out, and thinned down 
POR 15 seeping it between all the panels. POR 15 bonds with rust and will prevent 
any rust which is in between the panels from spreading. </font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="wheelwell2.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the POR15 
  I sprayed the area with PPG DP40, an epoxy primer, and applied fresh 3M seam 
  sealer (not shown). The metal prepping process before paint starts with a good 
  cleaning with a scotchbrite wheel on an angle grinder, then is followed by cleaning 
  with a Oil, grease and wax remover. This product is basically naptha, with a 
  couple other additives. After the oil and wax remover, its time for a complete 
  wipe down of with metal prep. Metal prep is a weak acid that opens up the pours 
  of the steel, and gets any remaining non oil, or wax type dirt off the steel. 
  It is water based and is available at any Automotive paint store in concentrated 
  form. usually it is mixed 3:1 with water. I put it in a spray bottle and mist 
  the area, let it stand on the metal for 2-3 minutes, and wipe off with a clean 
  rag. Make sure you wear rubber gloves and eye protection when using all of these 
  products, they are really hard on your hands.</font></strong></TT> </p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="innersill2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the finished 
repair to the inner sill. I ended up getting all but about 1/8&quot; of the dip 
out of this area. Started with over 1/4&quot; dip. Then it was leaded to fill 
the remaining space. Looks like new, ready for paint. Notice the inside of the 
body is painted and I used small amounts of glazing puddy to get out minor low 
spots. I don't recommend it for any major low spots as it takes forever to dry 
and shrinks as it dries In these cases it was used to fill dips that were no more 
than 1 Millimeter deep. I let the puddy dry for at least a month before sanding. 
I'll use plastic filler or lead to surface any other dents which are to hard to 
ding out.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="bottombeforepaint1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bottom of the 
car and firewall are now ready for priming. clean, prepped and dry. I used a small 
amount of tape to mask off the areas where I didn't want paint. I use a touch 
up paint gun which is easy to control over spray isn't a big problem. In this 
round of painting I did the firewall, inside of the car and exterior floor. It 
consumed about a quart of paint.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="botpaint1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the bottom 
after paint and with a little filler. Having this part of the car primed stops 
the flash rust cold and lets me focus on the upper body work. Unlike the high 
end professional shops my garage isn't climate controlled so as the season turns 
from summer to fall, risk of rust increases.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="bottompaint4.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another shot of 
the same, some minor dents in the floor rails were hard to get out, but I'm expecting 
that after a high build primer it will not be noticeable.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="cleanfloor3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320>
</CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This shot of the 
inside of the car is just before painting. I did the same seeping of POR 15 into 
all the joints, shouldn't ever rust again if this stuff is as good as they say. 
</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="intpaint1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another shot of 
the inside of the body after prime. A few dots of primer on the main cross member. 
The lack of major rust on this car helps make up for the substantial body damage 
I painted all of the inner boxes as well in the dash with a combo of POR15 and 
Epoxy primer, then shot a coat of body wax on top.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="susframeafterpaint1.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Primed the rear 
suspension frame at the same time, it will later get a coat or two of gloss black 
epoxy, for now it goes into storage.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="transtunnel1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Had to include 
this shot of the passenger side cowl. This had a large hole cut in it presumably 
to allow access to the transmission bolts. I cut out the mangled area and welded 
in a patch, then ground it down. Without use of any filler I was able to paint 
it. Can't even see its there unless you really strain.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorshell3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Door shells are 
now ready for re skinning. I will sand off the paint in the weld areas and put 
a weld through primer on first. Then install new skins. </font></strong></TT> <CENTER>
<CENTER><img src="doorskins1.JPG" height=320 width=240></CENTER>
  <TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new shells 
  from Martin Robey were about $60 each. I ordered a batch of sheet metal, including 
  new cowl, sill ends, door skins and floor pans, All of which was around $400. 
  Condition of the parts was good, and service was prompt and professional.</font></strong></TT> 
  <CENTER><IMG SRC="doorskinning1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first order 
was to test fit the skin on the shell to see how everything lines up. I sanded 
the paint off of the inside of the door where the welds would be, and dressed 
the shell to get out all of the high and low spots which later could cause problems. 
This process took about 2 hours and ten or fifteen trial fits. Vice Grips are 
a must when doing fitting like this. I have several pairs of large welders Vice 
Grips which were large enough to reach around the shell and lock the entire skin 
in place on the frame.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorskinning2.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
  <p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I removed 
    the drip tray from each door and bead blasted it. These are riveted and brazed 
    on so a torch is required to remove them. After I cleaned up the parts I refit 
    each and painted the hidden areas with POR 15. I mig welded the parts back 
    in place vs brazing, unless you are really good with a torch, stay away from 
    thin sheet metal. I use a dremil tool to dress the welds in tight spots like 
    this.</font></strong></TT></p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="doorskinning6.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
  <TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After everything 
  perfectly fitted, Spot weld the inner braces to the skin. I use my mig welder 
  and drill holes in any place which needs a simulated spot weld. I've considered 
  a spot welder, but so far haven't really needed one. I get pretty good results 
  with the mig welder, not quite factory in appearance, but pretty close, and 
  so far all the welds are hidden.</font></strong></TT> 
  <CENTER><IMG SRC="doorskinning4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
  <TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here the skins 
  are starting to fold over. This is a touchy process, and really requires a door 
  skinning hammer. Door skinning hammers have a hooked head which is wide and 
  crowned so it gives just the right type blow to fold over the metal. After each 
  side is folded over I flatten out the edge with the same hammer and a dolly, 
  and then drill every inch and weld the skin on the frame.</font></strong></TT> 
  <CENTER><IMG SRC="doorskinning7.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The compound curves 
on this skin require a few extra cuts along the edge to avoid problems. Tin snips 
work well for these, but as usual some trial and error is required.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="dooroncar3.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One part of the 
process I didn't take any pictures of was the making of drip covers on the bottom 
of the door, there are two on each door, I used the old parts as patterns and 
cut and shaped new ones from light gauge sheet metal scrap. The doors are still 
in rough shape but are ready for trial fitting on the car, For now I'll leave 
them this way, but later will be trimming them down and cleaning up low spots 
as the door area is leaded in. First I need to put the cowl on.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="dooroncar1.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not quite there 
yet but nothing a couple dozen more hours of labor won't fix. So far I have about 
8 hours in each door and who knows how many hours in the rest. at least a hundred 
hours in body work I'd guess. Next the cowl goes on, the roof gets cut out and the 
floor pans are installed.</font></strong></TT>
