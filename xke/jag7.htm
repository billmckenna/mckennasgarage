<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The blast company 
spet 10-11 hours blasting to complete and turnaround time was about 2 weeks.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER>

<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The work saved 
by having the car blasted is impossible to calculate. Every inch of the car inside 
and out is perfectly clean. Even inside the sills and other hidden areas are pretty 
clean. The only complaint is that the car now bleeds sand. Spent several hours 
blowing air into all the hidden areas and vacuuming, but still get some sand spilling 
out. Over time it stopped, but it took 3-4 months of banging on the shell and 
turning the car around on the rotisserie to get all the sand out.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst10.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The down side 
of getting the metal perfectly clean is that now every hole and dent is clearly 
visible. When I inspected the car at the blasters, the owner said the car looked 
like it had been in a machine gun battle. hundreds of holes had been punched into 
the body by the bondo bodgers and even more body damange I didn't expect.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst16.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to 
getting the car blasted, the shop had a large powdercoating oven which they used 
to bake the body. The car was cooked at 400 degrees for 3 hours. This cures the 
metal, and melts most of the old seam sealer out and any remaining lead. According 
to the shop the steel will resist flash rust much longer after cooking. The hood 
sections had been repaired in a number of places and were far from perfect, fortunately 
no major problems in the sheet metal which will force replacement.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst18.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rear end damage 
is pretty extensive, Blasting didn't help, holes that were 1/4&quot; turned into 
1/2&quot;. Metal that was a little thin was lost all together. Still its good 
to know where the problems are. Lots of work ahead getting this body back into 
good condition.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst20.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The underside of 
the car was pretty solid except for the trunk tub, I found some small rust areas 
in the wheel wells, but these were easy to cut out and patch.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst19.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trunk tub as 
mentioned before is messy. Not practical to save this. I'm sure if I had unlimited 
time I could do it, but it will be better to cut it out and buy a new one.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst5.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here you can see 
some of the front fender damage, along with the rear hatch. The hatch is probably 
just about the only part which doesn't need any metal work before painting.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back in the garage, 
the blasting took about 2 weeks. The shop I used charged about $80 an hour to 
do the job. The total was $900 to get everything blasted. This included the Sub 
frame, All the bonnet parts, the rear suspension frame, the shell, doors, a few 
small parts etc. If anyone in the bay area is looking for a good blaster contact 
me via email.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst6.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another shot of 
the rear end mess. Not much to say except what a mess. At least the damage appears 
to be localized to this part of the car. The hatch fits well, and if I can get 
the back fixed it should all be OK.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst7.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I discovered a 
few problems after blasting. First the cowl on the passenger side had rust out 
at the bottom where it meets the sill. I'll cut about 2 inches of it out and replace. 
Also the inner sill was warped. I fortunately have access to bang out most of 
this from below, but will also need to pull from the top, and fill in some of 
the damage with lead.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst8.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A car load of clean 
parts. Door shells, front bottom of the bonnet, sub frames etc. All ready for 
prep and prime. I removed the door skins before sending the shells out for blasting. 
I discovered a number of problems which I hadn't expected hidden under bondo, 
more later on these problems.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst12.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The lower bonnet 
tub had a hard life. A small amount of rust and a medium amount of damage. Fortunately 
nothing can't be fixed. The other parts of the hood were also a little rough, 
but all will be able to be salvaged.</font></strong></TT> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jagblst21.JPG" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=240></CENTER>
<TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here its easy 
to see the condition of the floors and the inner sill. Also some damage to the 
main cross support. The floor will be easy to weld up and flatten out the dents. 
Hammer and dolly, mig welding, and a stud welder will be a must to correct this.</font></strong></TT>
