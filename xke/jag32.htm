<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After getting 
  most of the smaller components rebuilt and ready to go on the car, I started 
  the longer term phase of rebuilding major mechanical sub components around October 
  2004 and hope to be complete by about December.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most garage 
  restorers avoid getting into complex units like differentials, however I wanted 
  to change my finial gear ratio from 3.54:1 to 3.07:1 because I found that the 
  stock 3.54 ratio made first gear completely useless. The 3.8Liter XK engine 
  with 3 SU's has plenty of torque to start even in second gear, and first gear 
  winds up to 3500 RPM before 20 mph. I also found that highway speeds of 70+ 
  were obtained in top gear running over 3000 rpm and the top speed with this 
  ratio at red line would be around 120mph vs the more exciting 140+ which the 
  3.07 produces. I also didn't like the idea of leaving 40 year old bearings and 
  clutch packs in alone in a car which had clearly had a hard life.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is what 
  I had after I shelled the differential. I found that several bad things had 
  been going wrong which made the tear down well warranted. The output shaft flanges 
  had been setup incorrectly the past and about 1/8&quot; of metal had been ground 
  off of side. The shims which were installed to set the end float on these shafts 
  were mangled and over time the unit would have most likely had a catastrophic 
  failure. I also found that clutch pack on one side had several cracked plates. 
  This was most likely caused by the incorrect forces starting at the output shafts, 
  or just general use and abuse. </font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next order 
  of business after tear down was sourcing parts! Finding ring and pinion gears 
  and bearings for a 40 year old differential is easier than you'd think. The 
  Jaguar IRS is based on a common Dana 44 gear set. These ring and pinion sets 
  are still being produced and are commonly found on Jeep Cherokee's and Ford 
  light duty trucks. Dana makes ratios from 3.07:1 up to about 4:1. I found a 
  good online source for gear and bearing sets. (Reider Racing). The ring and 
  pinion was about $160 and the Bearing set was another $150. Unfortunately the 
  bearings aren't all the same so some extra parts had to be found elsewhere.</font></strong></tt>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the 
  install kit for the new ring and pinion. It includes all seals bearings and 
  bolts to install to a modern Jag IRS less the output shafts. I also found that 
  the outer pinion bearing wasn't correct. Guess it is to much to ask that Jaguar 
  continue using the exact same bearings for over 40 years. This shortage forced 
  me to find another source for bearings who could take original Timken bearing 
  and race numbers and source parts. I used &quot;International Bearing&quot; 
  a mail order (non online) company. Located here in Northern CA. They had no 
  trouble finding any of the parts I needed! Prices were generally cheaper than 
  the usual Jaguar suppliers and I could specify Timken vs other bearing makes.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here 
    is the original outer pinion bearing along side the part from the kit. The 
    inside diameter is correct but the outside on the old bearing is about .250&quot; 
    larger than the one in the kit. The replacement roller and race cost about 
    $50.</font></strong></tt></p>

<tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It isn't hard 
to see the size difference in the 3.07 (left) pinion vs the 3.54 (right). The 
3.07 is a good bit bigger. Also the output shaft splines on the 3.07 are smaller 
and required a custom made output flange.</font></strong></tt>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here 
    is said flange. It doesn't look anything like the original, but has the same 
    bolt pattern and the correct tooth to fit the new pinion. I was a little worried 
    about it being Aluminum instead of steel, but this part was made by a shop 
    that specializes in AC Cobra Kit cars, so I assume if it can take the torque 
    from a Ford 427 it should be just fine for my little 3.8 Liter XK!</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting the 
  old bearings out was not something I could handle. But with some major help 
  from Dick Vandermeyden, we got them all off. Dick had to make a special puller 
  which was the combination of the bearing splitter seen here, which was locked 
  under the old roller cone, and a machined aluminum block which went between 
  the bolts. After the block was bolted down, Dick put a hydraulic micro jack 
  between the aluminum block and the center shaft on the plate, and pressed the 
  bearing off 1/4&quot; inch at a time. All of the other bearings and races came 
  off with a standard press and no special tooling.</font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stripping the 
  non syncro Moss manual transmission went pretty smoothly. No special tools or 
  pressing was required! I'll powder coat the case and repaint the interior with 
  Glyptol. On the bell housing it will just get a good cleaning and polishing. 
  The seals were worn out on both ends of the main shaft, but otherwise it was 
  in pretty good shape.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <img src="Trans1_1crop.jpg" height="384" width="512"> 
</center>
<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are lots 
  of parts involved with any transmission, all of which need to be cleaned and 
  inspected for unnatural wear or damage. Luckily everything was in pretty good 
  shape, I bought new main shaft bearings, but found that the new replacement 
  bearings had more slop in them than the originals so I decided to just reuse 
  all the original bearings and take my chances. The seals and gasket sets are 
  available from &quot;the usual's&quot; along with rubber shift bushings and 
  other small bits you may loose in the rebuild process, watch out for flying 
  springs, roller balls and pistons, in the syncro gears. </font></strong></tt></p>

<p><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are the 
  needle bearings and oil pump plates for the lay shaft. The lay shaft is a single 
  unit an must be lowered into the bottom of the case before putting the main 
  shaft in. After the main shaft is in place the lay shaft is lifted up into place.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here 
    is a shot of the lay shaft. The needle bearings fit inside and are then held 
    in place by the shaft. The shop manual recommends using a dummy shaft to install 
    the lay shaft but several people I've talked to say its not that hard to install 
    without the dummy shaft, so I'll give it a whirl.</font></strong></tt></p>

      main shaft and a couple of the syncro rings laying around. One of the main 
      shaft bearings is in the background. and parts of the shifter linkage is 
      in front. Its all fairly straight forward &quot;40s&quot; technology, but 
      only goes together one way. Thank goodness for the shop manual.</font></strong></tt></p>

  <p align="left"><tt><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    only stripped the transmission top and shifting unit down to this point. It 
    was all working perfectly and really just needed a good cleaning. I installed 
    new safety wires on all the shift fork bolts along with lock tight, just to 
    be sure everything stays put. </font></strong></tt></p>

    is the shifter linkage housing which bolts on the transmission top. It was 
    bead blasted and wire wheeled then rebuilt. I used most of the original parts, 
    very little wear, and most parts are impossible to find new.</font></strong></tt></p>

      is the rear plate where the output would come out. Again I bead blasted 
      and polished this, then installed new seals and gaskets. This unit also 
      holds the speedo gear drive, and the rear transmission mount. This car #888082 
      was one of the first cars to have the single pin and spring arrangement 
      for transmission mounting. </font></strong></tt></p>
