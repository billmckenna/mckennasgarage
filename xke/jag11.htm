    on currently and is never quite done. I would estimate at least 20 hours of 
    plastic filling and sanding and are to be seen in the below shots, but work 
    is far from finished.<BR>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I really wanted 
  to avoid plastic filler, but after discussions with several professional body 
  men and significant reading I became convinced that with proper application, 
  modern plastic fillers are hard to beat. Use very thin layers of plastic to 
  level out high and low areas, and generally keep the thickness of the plastic 
  less than 1/8 inch. Deep dents are either filled with lead or dinged out with 
  a hammer and dolly. I like to think of it as high build primer that is applied 
  without a spray gun. I only apply Rage to bare metal. I have been using &quot;Evercoat 
  RAGE&quot; and find that its adhesion to bare clean steel is better than Epoxy 
  etching primer.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After replacing 
  the front section of the roof there were a number of high and low spots associated 
  with my less than perfect welding skills. These small warps were due to over 
  heating. I realized quickly the warping so only a few places were high and low. 
  I hammered and shrunk out most of the problems, I skimmed the roof with plastic. 
  to get it right. Learning to work with plastic filler took some time. I learned 
  that it is best to put down two our three thin coats of filler and then to sand 
  when there are major high and lows. Sanding between each coat shows off the 
  high spots, but the tendency is to sand through each and re-discover the high 
  spots. The best approach is to sand until you just start to see a little metal 
  beginning to show. then stop and apply more filler in a wide area around the 
  high until you get to a point where no metal comes through. I use an electric 
  sander with 80 and 120 grit paper to knock off the edge off the plastic, and 
  then use a 20 inch long sanding block for 36 grit for the basic block out. A 
  guide coat can help too but tends to soak into the plastic so its best to go 
  very light on the spray onto plastic.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sills had 
  a few small dents which I filled and sanded out. I also used plastic to dress 
  the lead in the doors. Plastic is messy to work with, I spend about as much 
  time cleaning up from it as I do sanding and filling.</font></strong></TT> </p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After everything 
  is sanded out and smooth I shot a coat of PPG DP 40 Epoxy primer. DP40 is fine 
  to spray on top of plastic filler, I will shoot a thin coat of High build primer 
  on the inside and wet sand out before shooting color.</font></strong></TT></p>

the bottom with very slight amount of plastic filler, and shot DP40. The bottom 
is ready for rocker guard now.</font></strong></TT>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rear end 
  is still a mess, need to cut all of the unpolished steel out and replace. The 
  rest of the body is ready to buff out and prime. I'll start on the bonnet next.</font></strong></TT></p>

<p><TT><strong><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sills and 
  cowl were less than perfect even after lead. I leaded the upper and lower seam 
  and then skimmed both cowls with filler to get the high and low spots and to 
  blend the door contour to the cowl. If I was doing this over I would have waited 
  until the bonnet was on the car before getting into plastic filler here. It 
  would have been better to continue working with the lead after the bonnet was 
  fitted to the body. Lesson learned. </font></strong></TT> <font size="+1"><A HREF="jag2.html"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></A></font></p>
